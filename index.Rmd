# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) here or
# use code similar to line 22-23 for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, you can delete or silence lines 21-32 in this YAML header.
#abstract: |
#  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the `|`.
