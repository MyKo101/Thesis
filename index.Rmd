Add in written details in Supp. Material
Figure out scroll_box() for the PH Five-State
Make equations not in aligns (rolls onto second page in Five-State Model)
Write up current draft of other papers
pdf tables aren't aligned
Add Timeline
Figure out equation referencing
Download options showing up in pdf
Abstract subsections appearing in TOC in Thesis (e.g. 3.0.1 Background)
Add "Appendix" heading (or page) to thesis version

Welcome to my Thesis. This is formatted as `r fb("a full Gitbook style thesis", "a full UoM formatted thesis", "an individual paper")`.
  
I sent an email with details of how you can log in to the [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) system. This will let you add comments to the gitbook pages. This is actually a really useful tool to add annotations to *any* webpage. Just highlight the text you want to comment on, and the annotate bubble pops up. Make sure you click Post to Public after writing the annotation (Note that annotations can contain Rich Text / Markdown).

I've written this document to be ready to become my thesis, but each chapter is a separate file, which I can output individually if/when I need.


I've also outlined my expected timeline below. This thesis document, along with each chapter's files (at their respective urls) will be updated.

`r fb(gitbook="## Abstract {-}")`

`r {source("prelim_Subsection.R");prelim_Subsection("html","abstract")}`
