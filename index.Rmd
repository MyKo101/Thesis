# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) here or
# use code similar to line 22-23 for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, you can delete or silence lines 21-32 in this YAML header.

  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the `|`.

  I would like to thank my wife, Rachel, for her constant support throughout my studies. She acted as sounding board for my most boring of thoughts and allowed me to rant and rave about statistical models in every way possible. She would . She endured my frustrations when something wasn't working and encouraged me when my optimism turned to pesimism.
  My thanks also go to my children, Matilda and Theodore, who were an everlasting source of happiness and reprieve from my work. Acting as a distraction (in the best and worst ways) and an incentive.
  My everlasting gratitude will always lie with my parents, Brenda and Andy, who have allowed me to be myself and to find my own path. They never pushed me into something that I didn't want to do, but also guided me towards what I would be good at.
