Welcome to my Thesis. I've used R Markdown to create a gitbook style thesis, as well as a traditional pdf (following the UoM Thesis template). `r fb(gitbook="The pdf version can be downloaded via the menu at the top.", thesis="The html version can be found [here](https://michaelbarrowman.co.uk/thesis).")`
  
I sent an email with details of how you can log in to the [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) system. This will let you add comments to the gitbook pages. This is actually a really useful tool and has the ability to add annotations to any webpage. Annotated text can be seen highlighted and to add your own, just highlight the text you want to comment on, and the annotate bubble pops up (try it now). Make sure you click Post to Public after writing the annotation and annotations can include Rich Text and Markdown. You can view Annotations by clicking the menu on the right and this will show all comments.

Google Docs was great, but when I started to use R Markdown for other purposes, I realised I could embed tables and equations much easier and automatically using `kable`. Google Docs on it's own became rather clunky (especially with tables, just like Word) and whenever I updated a document using R Markdown, any comments that were added to the document were lost. It was also difficult for you to remember *where* each document lived. Since R Markdown can also output to `LaTeX` I thought it would be easier to collate papers together. I'd have had to do this kind of transition over to`LaTeX` for my thesis eventually and this would have been difficult and tedious from Google Docs or Word.
  

Importantly, I've also added in functionality to output each chapter individually. For unpublished papers, there will be a link to download the pdf and tex versions of the individual paper.



Everything here is hosted in a [Github repo](https://https://github.com/MyKo101/Thesis). I originally used Github as my backup, but then decided to increase how I used it.

`r fb(gitbook="## Abstract {-}")`

`r {source("prelim_Subsection.R");prelim_Subsection("html","abstract")}`
