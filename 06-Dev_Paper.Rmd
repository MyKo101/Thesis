## Abstract {-}

### Objectives {-}

### Background {-}

Clinical Prediction Models (CPMs) provide individualised predictions for patient outcomes. Traditionally, these models provide predictions for single outcomes, however in many circumstances, the ability to predict a multi-dimensional outcome with a single model can be advantageous. Many CPMs have been developed to predict the risk of different outcomes in individuals following chronic kidney disease (CKD) onset, but few allow the ability to predict the risk of patients transitioning onto renal replacement therapy (RRT) as well as death. For example, the risk of having a transplant within 1 year following dialysis, or the risk of remaining on dialysis until death. Multi-state models provide the vehicle to make such predictions, but have not been used within the CKD context.

### Objective {-}
<mark>Our objective was to develop a Multi-State Clinical Prediction Model (MSCPM), which can be used to predict patient progression through three states, untreated CKD (CKD), Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) and Death (Dead).

### Methods {-}

We developed ~~a Multi-State Clinical Prediction Model (MSCPM)~~<mark> our model</mark> using tertiary care data from the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) as our development data set and secondary care data from the West of Scotland (SERPR) dataset as our external validation set. ~~We developed three models of different levels of complexity; a Two-State Model (Alive and Dead), a Three-State Model (Untreated CKD, Renal Replacement Therapy and Dead) and a Five-State model (Untreated CKD, Haemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, Transplant and Dead)~~.<mark> State transition were modelled using the Royston-Parmer regression technique and combined to create a single model.</mark> Model performance was assessed for accuracy, discrimination and calibration using methods both internally and externally. <mark>The model was then used to create an online calculator.</mark>

### Results {-}

~~Of the three models produced,~~Age was a strong predictor of mortality ~~in all cases~~ and outcomes were highly dependent on primary renal diagnosis. Models performed well in both the internal and external validation with ~~the Three-State Model out performing overall with~~ a Brier Score of 0.67/0.62 (internal/external, respectively), c-statistic of 0.83/0.81 and an averaged calibration intercept of 0.00/0.00 and slope diagonal of 1.34/1.53 (indicating under-prediction of all non-untreated CKD states for more extreme values).

### Discusssion {-}

Our CPM~~s~~ provide<mark>s</mark> clinicians and patients with multi-dimensional predictions across different outcome states and any time point. This implies that users of these models can get more information about their potential future without a loss to the model's calibration nor its discriminative ability.

## Introduction

A clinical prediction model (CPM) is a tool which provides patients and clinicians with a measure of how likely a patient is to suffer a specific clinical event, more specifically, a prognostic model allows the prediction of future events [@steyerberg_prognosis_2013]. CPMs use data from previous patients to estimate the outcomes of an individual patient. Prognostic models can be used in clinical practice to influence treatment decisions.


Within Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), prognostic models have been developed to predict mortality [@johnson_predicting_2007; @landray_prediction_2010; @bansal_development_2015; @marks_looking_2015; @wick_clinical_2017], End-Stage Renal Disease [@landray_prediction_2010], the commencements of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) [@marks_looking_2015; @johnson_predicting_2008; @schroeder_predicting_2017; @kulkarni_transition_2017] or mortality after beginning dialysis [@floege_development_2015; @hemke_survival_2013; @cao_predicting_2015]. Some previous models have used the commencement of RRT as a proxy for CKD Stage V [@tangri_predictive_2011; @roy_statistical_2017; @tangri_dynamic_2017], while others have investigated the occurrence of cardiovascular events within CKD patients[@shlipak_cardiovascular_2005; @weiner_framingham_2007; @mcmurray_predictors_2011]. Reviews by Grams & Coresh [@grams_assessing_2013], Tangri et al [@tangri_risk_2013] and Ramspek et al [@ramspek_prediction_2017], which explored the different aspects of assessing risk amongst CKD or RRT patients, found that the current landscape of CKD prediction models is lacking from both a methodological and clinical perspective [@collins_transparent_2015; @bouwmeester_reporting_2012-1]. 


Methodologically, the majority of existing CKD prediction models fail to account for competing events [@bansal_development_2015; @wick_clinical_2017; @perotte_risk_2015], have high risks of bias [@johnson_predicting_2007; @landray_prediction_2010; @johnson_predicting_2008] or are otherwise flawed compared to modern clinical prediction standards [@collins_transparent_2015; @steyerberg_prognosis_2013].<mark> These can have large implications if these models were to be used in clinical practice as, for example, patients could be given a predicted probabilty of RRT, which has not been adjusted for the probability of death and is thus, in fact a probability of RRT, assuming you don't die (a very different value if you have a high risk of death)</mark>.


In 2013, Begun et al [@begun_identification_2013] developed a multi-State model for assessing population-level progression through the severity stages of CKD (III-V), RRT and/or death, which can be used to provide a broad statement regarding a patient's future. In 2014, Allen et al [@allen_chronic_2014] applied a similar model to liver transplant recipients and their progression through the stages of CKD with a focus on the predictions of measured vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (mGFR vs eGFR). In 2017, Kulkarni et al [@kulkarni_transition_2017] developed an MSM focusing on the categories of Calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies and kidney transplant and/or death. 

Most recently, in 2018, Grams et al [@grams_predicting_2018] developed a multinomial clinical prediction model for CKD patients which focused on the occurrence of RRT and/or cardiovascular events. As of the publication of this paper, this is the only currently existing CPMs of this kind for CKD patients.

However, the first three of these existing models (Begun, Allen and Kulkarni) categorise continuous variables to define their states at specific cut-offs and this has been shown to be inefficient when modelling [@royston_dichotomizing_2006] and none of these models have undergone any validation process, whether internal or external [@altman_prognosis_2009].

It is also important to note that although these models can be used to predict patient outcomes, they were not designed to produce individualised patient predictions as is a key aspect of a clinical prediction model; they were designed to assess the methodological advantages of MSMs in this medical field, to describe the prevalence of  over time of different CKD stages and to produce population level predictions for patients with different levels of  panel-reactive antibodies [@royston_prognosis_2009].

The fourth model (Grams), is presented as a Multi-State Model and the transitions involved were studied and defined, however the underlying statistical model is two multinomial logistic models analysed at 2 and 4 years, which assumes homogeneity of transition times. Two downsides to the implementation of this model are that it can only produce predictions at those predefined time points and that it is unable to estimate duration of time on dialysis.

Therefore, our aim is to develop a MSCPM - we do this by modeling patient pathways through a Multi-State Model by choosing transition points which can be exactly identified and include states which produce a clinical difference in patient characteristics. Our modeling techniques allow for individual predictions of multi-dimensional outcomes at any time point . The models produced by this process will then be validated, both internally and externally, to compare their results and demonstrate the transportability of the  clinical prediction models. ~~We report our work in line with the TRIPOD guidelines for development and validation of clinical prediction models [@collins_transparent_2015; @moons_transparent_2015].~~

## Methods

We report our work in line with the TRIPOD guidelines for development and validation of clinical prediction models [@collins_transparent_2015; @moons_transparent_2015].

### Data Sources

The models were developed using data from the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) cohort of patients (previously named the CRISIS cohort), established in the Department of Renal Medicine, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT). The SKS is a large longitudinal CKD cohort recruiting CKD patients since 2002. This cohort collects detailed annualised phenotypic and laboratory data, and plasma, serum and whole blood stored at -80\textdegree C for biomarker and genotypic analyses. Recruitment of patients into SKS has been described in multiple previous studies [@hoefield_factors_2010;
@chinnadurai_increased_2019-1] and these have included a CKD progression prognostic factor study and to evidence the increased risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic kidney patients. In brief, any patient referred to Salford renal service (catchment population 1.5 million) who is 18 years or over and has an eGFR measurement of less than $60\textrm{ml}/\textrm{min}/1.73\textrm{m}^2$ (calculated using the CKD-EPI formula [@levey_new_2009]) was approached to be consented for the study participation.

At baseline, the data, including demographics, comorbidities, physical parameters, lab results and primary renal diagnosis are recorded in the database. Patients undergo an annual study visit and any changes to these parameters are captured. All data except blood results are collected via questionnaire by a dedicated team of research nurses. Blood results (baseline and annualised), first RRT modality and mortality outcome data are directly transferred to the database from Salford's Integrated Record  [@new_obtaining_2014]. eGFR, uPCR, comorbidity and blood results were measured longitudinally throughout a patient's time within the cohort. 

Due to limitations in our data, we were agnostic to how long since patients were diagnosed with CKD. Therefore, we defined a patient's start date for our model as their first date after consent at which their eGFR was recorded to be below $60\textrm{ml}/\textrm{min}/1.73\textrm{m}^2$. Some patients consented with an eGFR that was already below 60, and some entered our study later when their eGFR was measured to be below 60. This implies that our models includes both patient who have recently been diagnosed with CKD ($\textrm{eGFR} \lessapprox 60$) *and* those that have been suffering with CKD for an arbitrary amount of time. This timelessness of the model means it can be applied to any patient <mark>prior to commencement of RRT</mark> at any time<mark> after their initial CKD diagnosis, be that immediately or 10 years later</mark> ~~during their CKD journey prior to commencement of RRT.~~

All patients registered in the database between October 2002 and December 2016 with available data were included in this study. As this is a retrospective convenience sample, no sample size calculations were performed prior to recruitment.<mark>However, we were able use the given sample size to calculate the maximum number of predictors for each transition as per Riley, et al [@riley_minimum_2019], which permitted us to use over 150 predictors for each transition</mark>. All patients were followed-up within SKS until the end-points of RRT, death or loss to follow-up or were censored at their last interaction with the healthcare system prior to December 2017. Date of death for patients who commenced RRT was  also included in the SKS database.

For external validation of the model, we extracted an independent cohort from the West of Scotland Electronic Renal Patient Record (SERPR). Our extract of SERPR contains all patients known to the Glasgow and Forth Valley renal service who had an eGFR measure of less than $60\textrm{ml}/\textrm{min}/1.73m^2$ between January 2006 and January 2016. This cohort has been previously used in Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis consortium studies investigating outcomes in patients with CKD [@matsushita_cohort_2013] and a similar cohort has been used for the analysis of skin tumours amongst renal transplant patients. Use of anonymised data from this database has been approved by the West of Scotland Ethics Committee for use of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde 'Safe Haven' data for research.

Both the internal and external validation cohort were used as part of the multinational validation cohort used by Grams et al in their multinomial CPM discussed above [@grams_predicting_2018]. In SERPR, start dates were calculated to be the first time point where the following conditions were met:

* eGFR is measured at less than 60
* There is at least one prior eGFR measurement
* Patient is 18 or over

The second requirement was implemented to avoid a bias in the eGFR Rate. eGFR Rate is a measure of the change in eGFR over time and is calculated as the difference between the most recent two eGFR measurements divided by the time between them. For patients who entered the system with an $\textrm{eGFR} < 60$, their eGFR Rate would be unavailable (i.e. missing). Otherwise, patient eGFRs would *have* to drop to below 60 and thus eGFR Rate would be negative. In addition, to avoid Acute Kidney Incident events, we also filtered measurements of eGFR Rate that were more extreme than 1.5x those found in the SKS population. 

### Model Design

Three separate models were developed, so we could determine a clinically viable model while maintaining model parsimony as much as possible: a Two-State, Three-State and Five-State model, each building on the previous models' complexity (see figure \@ref(fig:State-Diagram)). The Two-State model was a traditional survival analysis where a single event (death) is considered. The Three-State model expanded on this, by splitting the Alive state into transient states of (untreated) CKD and (first) RRT; patients can therefore transition from CKD to Death or CKD to RRT, and then onto RRT to Death. The Five-State model stratifies the RRT state into HD, PD and Tx and allows similar transitions into and out of the RRT states; however, the transition from Tx to Death was not considered as it was anticipated a priori that there would be insufficient patients undergoing this transition and that the process of undergoing a transplant would be medically transformative and so it would be inappropriate to assume shared parameters before and after the transition (i.e. Tx was modelled as a second absorbing state).

knitr::include_graphics("figure/Dev_Paper_State_Diagrams.png")
```

Missing data was handled using multiple imputation [@white_imputing_2009] using times for all events as imputation covariates. Variables considered as covariates were demographics (sex, age, smoking status and alcohol consumption), comorbidities (congestive cardiac failure (CCF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior  cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic liver disease (LD), prior myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and slid tumour (ST)), physical parameters (BMI, blood pressure), blood results (haemoglobin, albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate measures), urine protein creatinine ratio (uPCR) and primary renal diagnosis (grouped as per ERA-EDTA classifications [@venkat-raman_new_2012]). From these variables, uPCR and eGFR Rate of change were also derived [@kovesdy_past_2016; @naimark_past_2016] as well as their log transforms and log(Age) and Age$^2$. For each transition, Backwards-forwards stepwise methods were used to minimise the AIC, allowing different variables to be used for each transition. <mark>Variables were also assessed for their adherence to the proportional hazards assumption by calculating their Schoenfeld residual [@grambsch_proportional_1994; @schoenfeld_partial_1982], for those that fail the test of proportionality, we include a time trend in their hazard estimate</mark>.

### Validation

Each of the three models were internally validated in the development dataset using bootstrapping to adjust for optimism and then further externally validated in the validation dataset extracted from SERPR [@schomaker_bootstrap_2018]. The bootstrapping method was also used for both validations to produce confidence intervals around the performance metric estimates. To assess the performance in low eGFR patients, the models were also validated in subsets of the SKS and SERPR where patients had an eGFR < 30/ml/min/1.73m`r fb("<sup>2</sup>","\\textsuperscript{2}","\\textsuperscript{2}")`.

Model accuracy was assessed using the Brier Score, discrimination was assessed using the c-statistic and the calibration was assessed using the multi-dimensional intercept and slope-matrix`r fb(single=" [@chap-performance-metrics]",gitbook=", as described in Chapter \\@ref(chap-performance-metrics)", thesis=", as described in Chapter \\@ref(chap-performance-metrics)")`. These measures were taken at One-Year, Two-Years and Five-Years after the patient's start dates, and therefore are equivalent to validation measures at that point in time after a prediction has been applied.

Further details of how the models were developed and validated is discussed in the Supplementary materials`r fb(" in appendix \\@ref(chap-dev-paper-supp)"," in appendix \\@ref(chap-dev-paper-supp)")`.

### Example

Once the models have been developed, we will apply them to three example patients to demonstrate their use and applicability to the general population. We will provide a direct clinical estimation of these patient outcomes based on years of nephrological experience and compare this with the results presented by our clinical prediction model.

We have chosen three (synthetic) patients to use as examples of the use of our model. Their details can be seen in table \@ref(tab:Example-Patient).


```{r Example-Patient, echo=F}
tibble(id = 1:3,Age=c("20","40","66"),Gender=c("Female","Male","Female"),
       `Smoking Status`=c("Non-Smoker","Smoker","Non-Smoker"),
       BP=c("144/101","160/90","140/80"),
       Albumin=c("39","40","40"),`Correct Calcium`=c("2.3","3.0","2.6"),
       Haemoglobin=c("150","100"," 14"), Phosphate=c("0.68","2.00","0.86"),
       eGFR=c("42","10","51"),
       `eGFR Previous`=c("50 (one week ago)","30 (one year ago)","70 (one week ago)"),
       uPCR=c("0.30","0.20","0.01"),
       `uPCR Previous`=c("0.80 (one month ago)","1.20 (one year ago)","0.06 (one week ago)"),
       `Primary Diagnosis`=c("Glomerulonephritis","Tubular Necrosis","Diabetes"),
       Comorbities=c("Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nLiver Disease\nSolid Tumour","",
                     "Diabetes\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nHypertension")) %>%
  pivot_longer(-id,names_to="Vars",values_to="Vals") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=id,values_from=Vals,names_prefix="Patient ") %>%
  to_kable(caption="Details of the Example Patients",
           row_names="Vars",
           col_widths=rep("3.5cm",4))
```

Our three example patients cover a broad range of ages and other covariates. A clinically guided prediction for these patients would assume that Patient 1 has a high chance of proceeding as normal (with little need for RRT), Patient 2 would be recommended to start RRT soon and Patient 3 would be predicted to have a high risk of mortality with or without RRT.

### Calculator

As part of this work, we have also  produced an online calculator to allow patients and clinicians to easily estimate outcomes without worrying about the mathematics involved.

All analysis was done in `R 3.6.2` [@r_core_team_r_nodate] using the various `tidyverse` packages [@wickham_tidy_2017], as well as the `mice` [@buuren_mice_2011-1], `flexsurv` [@jackson_flexsurv:_nodate], `nnet` [@ripley_package_2016] and `furrr` [@vaughan_furrr_2018] packages. The calculator was produced using the `shiny` package [@chang_shiny_2020].

## Results

### Data Sources

As seen in table \@ref(tab:Table-One), the Age of the populations had a mean of 64.4  and 65.9 respectively with a very broad range. Due to the inclusion criteria, eGFR were capped at a maximum of 60, and was consistent across populations; however, the rate of change for eGFR was much wider in the SERPR patients than in the SKS, and it was decreasing much faster, on average ( -25 vs 0) .  The uPCR measures are presented in our results as g/mmol, rather than the more conventional g/mol, this is to better present results and coefficients of varying magnitudes.  Levels of missingness were much higher in the SERPR dataset in most continuous variables.

```


Table \@ref(tab:Table-One) also shows a breakdown of the categorical variables across the populations. In the development population, crude proportions of males were numerically higher than females whereas in the validation population the proportions are much more matched (62.6% male vs 50.4% male). Most patients were white in the SKS dataset, and ethnicity has extremely high missingness in SERPR, which also contributed to its omission from the model. 

Overall, there were high levels of comorbidities within the SKS population, but these levels were much lower in the SERPR population.


The median date for the date of death was 3.9 years in the SKS population and 4.9 years in the SERPR population. The median date for transition to RRT was 2.2 years and 1.5 years (in SKS and SERPR respectively). In SKS, transitions to HD happened 6 months later than PD, and in SERPR it was 3.6 months. The Maximum followup time in SKS was 15.0 years and in SERPR it was 10.1 years. This information can be seen in table \@ref(tab:Event-Median2).

```

### Development

Here we present the proportional hazards and covariate time trends for the Three-State Model in \@ref(tab:PH-Three). The full model description, including proportional and baseline hazards can be found in the Supplementary Materials`r fb(" in appendix \\@ref(chap-dev-paper-supp)"," in appendix \\@ref(chap-dev-paper-supp)")`. Older patients are predicted to be likely to transition to RRT. Increased rates of decline of eGFR were associated with the transition from CKD to RRT. The effect of older Age decreased over time for higher values of Age (as seen by the time trend).

```{r PH-Three,echo=F}
print_table_PH("data/Dev_Paper/Hazard_Ratios.csv",3)
```


Female patients are predicted to be more likely to remain in the CKD state than Males, or to remain in the RRT state once there. Smokers were predicted as more likely than Non-/Former Smokers to undergo any transition, apart from CKD to Tx. Blood results had associations with all transitions in some way, and disease etiology were strongly associated with the transitions giving a wide range of predictions.

### Validation

Table \@ref(tab:IV-Three) shows the results from the internal validation in the Three-State Model. Performance was overall slightly better in patients in the <60 eGFR group than in the <30 eGFR group. All measures degraded over time, but the average scores remained strong.

```{r IV-Three,echo=F}
res <- list_table_Valid("data/Dev_Paper/Validation.csv",3,F)
res[[1]]
```

Table \@ref(tab:EV-Three) shows the results from the external validation in the Three-State Model.


```{r EV-Three,echo=F}
res <- list_table_Valid("data/Dev_Paper/Validation.csv",3,T)
res[[1]]
```


### Example

The example patients seen in Table \@ref(tab:Example-Patient) were passed through our Three-State prediction model and the results for all time-points are shown in figure \@ref(fig:Example-Predictions-trend). The prognosis for all three patients were very different. Patient 1 (20 year old) had a very high probability of survival, with only an 16% chance of mortality by year 10 and 0% chance of commencing RRT. Patient 2 (40 year old) was predicted almost 90% chance of starting RRT, and over 70% chance of dying overall (either with or without RR). Patient 3 (66 year old) had a fast acceleration towards high mortality, after 1 year from the recorded measurements, they had more than 50% chance of dying, and after 2 years that probability rises to over 85% with no chance of RRT.

## Discussion

We have used data provided by SKS to develop a Multi-State Clinical Prediction Model and then validated this model within the SKS and SERPR datasets. Within our Models, the cause of a patient's renal disease had the widest effect on patient outcomes meaning that outcomes are highly dependent on ERA-EDTA classification of the diagnosis. Most groupings resulted in a lowered hazard of death and an increased hazard of RRT compared to the baseline of Systemic diseases.

The application of a Multi-state clinical prediction model to this field is novel and gives a powerful tool for providing individualised predictions of different outcomes at a wide range of time points. <mark>The model performed well under the scrutiny of validation and thus it can be considered to be reliable to predict state probabilities for patient's futures.</mark> ~~The model~~ It can also be used to estimate an expected amount of time that a patient will be on RRT The general inclusion criteria for the development dataset, and the wide range of patient ages and measurements allows for the model to be applied to a broad spectrum of patients.

Although the inclusion criteria for SKS were broad, the demographics of the local area resulted in homogeneity of ethnicity, which may create a limitation to the applicability of our model to non-white patients, <mark>however the contribution of ethnicity to health is intertwined with deprivation level[@jivraj_ethnicity_2013] and the high levels of deprivation in the catchment area of this cohort should account for this[@public_health_england_salford_2017]. The Renal Department at SRFT is a tertiary care facility for CKD sufferers and is well renowned for its capabilities of care meaning that it is likely to attract less-healthy patients from a wider catchment area, making the cohort of patients in the development population in worse condition than the general population of CKD patients. 

There were also high levels of missingness in the eGFR and uPCR rates of changes would also produce a bias, due to these measures likely being missing not at random. The derivation of the validation dataset ensured that all patients had an eGFR Rate measurement; this was done to avoid data missing not at random (only negative or missing data would be available as patient's eGFR dropped to less than 60), however deriving data in this way could itself induce a survivor bias in the start date used for patients.

The R-P models used require the assumption that the log cumulative hazard function follow a cubic spline, however this is a very weak assumption and is assumed to be reasonable in most situations [@royston_flexible_2002] and therefore we did not assess the viability of the cubic spline model. We have avoided the need for the requirements of the proportional hazards assumption by introducing time trends in the estimation of the hazard functions. <mark>This adds complexity to the model, but permits more dynamic and accurate predictions</mark>

Compared to the apparent internal validation, the model performance during the external validation was worse for all metrics. However, once adjusted for optimism, the results were much more cohesive which implies that the model is highly transportable to a new population without much alterations being required. Due to the differences in the healthcare systems of England and Scotland, it can be appreciated that despite the populations being similar, their care would be different enough to emphasise a larger difference between our populations than that shown in our (relatively homogeneous) populations.

Our paper has clearly demonstrated the accuracy of such a model. However, further research would be needed to establish the effectiveness and efficacy of its use in clinical practice [@moons_prognosis_2009-1] by comparing it to standard care and establishing whether the use of our model improves patient outcomes.

All three models produced for this work performed well in terms of accuracy, calibration and discrimination when applied internally and externally. This shows directly that the models are suitable for use in populations similar to both our development and our validation datasets. It can also be concluded that the models can be transported and applied to any population with a similar healthcare system to the UK.
