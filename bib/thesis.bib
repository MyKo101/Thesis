  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The accuracy of creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFR) in assessing the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated mortality after liver transplantation (LTx) is unknown. Using measured GFR (mGFR) by iothalamate clearance, we determined the prevalence of the entire spectrum of renal dysfunction and the impact of CKD on mortality after LTx.
METHODS: A database that prospectively tracks all LTx recipients at this academic transplant program from 1985 to 2012 was queried to identify all adult primary LTx recipients. Our post-LTx protocol incorporates GFR measurement by iothalamate clearance at regular intervals. A multistate model was used to assess the prevalence of CKD, kidney transplant, and death after LTx. Time-dependent Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of mGFR and eGFR changes on survival.
RESULTS: A total of 1211 transplant recipients were included. At the time of LTx, the median age was 54 years, 60\% were male and 86\% were Caucasian. At 25 years after LTx, 54\% of patients died, 9\% underwent kidney transplantation, whereas 7\%, 21\%, and 18\% had mGFR {$>$}60, 59-30, and {$<$}30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) respectively. The risk of death increased when mGFR decreased below 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2): HR = 2.67 (95\% CI = 1.80-3.96) for GFR = 29-15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and HR = 5.47 (95\% CI = 3.10-9.65) for GFR {$<$}15 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Compared to mGFR, eGFR underestimated mortality risk in LTx recipients with an eGFR of 30-90 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: An overwhelming majority of LTx recipients develop CKD. The risk of death increases exponentially when GFR {$<$}30 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Creatinine-based eGFR underestimates the mortality risk in a large proportion of patients.},

  abstract = {Measurements of continuous variables are made in all branches of medicine, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. In clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being ``hypertensive'' or ``obese'' or having ``high cholesterol,'' depending on the value of a continuous variable.

Categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. Though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. Here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1

What are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? A common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. A \ldots{}},

Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CKD is associated with mortality. Accurate prediction tools for mortality may guide clinical decision-making, particularly among elderly persons with CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: A prediction equation was developed for 5-year risk of mortality among participants with CKD in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Sixteen candidate predictor variables were explored, which included demographics, physical examination measures, comorbidity, medication use, and kidney function measures (eGFR calculated from serum creatinine and the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio). Models were developed using Cox regression and evaluated using c statistics. A final parsimonious model was externally validated in an independent cohort of community-living elders with CKD in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study.
RESULTS: The development cohort included 828 participants who had a mean age of 80 ({$\pm$}5.6) years and an eGFR of 47 ({$\pm$}11) ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and median albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 13 (interquartile range 6-51) mg/g. The validation cohort included 789 participants who had a mean age of 74 ({$\pm$}2.8) years and an eGFR of 50 ({$\pm$}9) ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and median albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 13 (interquartile range 6-42) mg/g. The final model for 5-year mortality risk included age, sex, race, eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and history of heart failure and stroke (c statistic=0.72; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.74). When a point-based system was assigned for each of nine variables in the equation, the estimated risk of death within 5 years ranged from 3.8\% among participants with the lowest scores to 83.6\% among participants with nine points. The model performed fair in external validation (c statistic=0.69; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: A simple prediction tool using nine readily available clinical variables can assist in predicting 5-year mortality risk in elderly patients with CKD, which may be useful in counseling patients and guiding clinical decision making.},

  abstract = {An appealing feature of multiple imputation is he simplicity of the rules for combining the multiple complete-data inferences into a final inference, the repeated-imputation inference (Rubin, 1987). This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees of freedom, {$\nu$}com, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m, is finite. When {$\nu$}com is small and there is only a modest proportion of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom, {$\nu$}m, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than {$\nu$}com, which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm, we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, {$\nu\tilde$}m, with the following three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information, {$\nu\tilde$}m monotonically increases in {$\nu$}com; {$\nu\tilde$}m is always less than or equal to {$\nu$}com; and {$\nu\tilde$}m equals {$\nu$}m when {$\nu$}com is infinite. A small simulation study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using {$\nu\tilde$}m rather than {$\nu$}m.},

This review presents data from nationally representative datasets to provide up-to-date statistics on mortality, prevalence, treatment and costs. Data focus on CVD as a whole, coronary heart disease (International Classification of Diseases (ICD):I20\textendash{}25) and cerebrovascular disease (ICD:I60\textendash{}69); however, where available, other cardiovascular conditions are also presented. In 2012, CVD was the most common cause of death in the UK for women (28\% of all female deaths), but not for men, where cancer is now the most common cause of death (32\% of all male deaths). Mortality from CVD varies widely throughout the UK, with the highest age-standardised CVD death rates in Scotland (347/100 000) and the North of England (320/100 000 in the North West). Prevalence of coronary heart disease is also highest in the North of England (4.5\% in the North East) and Scotland (4.3\%). Overall, around three times as many men have had a myocardial infarction compared with women. Treatment for CVD is increasing over time, with prescriptions and operations for CVD having substantially increased over the last two decades. The National Health Service in England spent around \textsterling{}6.8 billion on CVD in 2012/2013, the majority of which came from spending on secondary care. Despite significant declines in mortality in the UK, CVD remains a considerable burden, both in terms of health and costs. Both primary and secondary prevention measures are necessary to reduce both the burden of CVD and inequalities in CVD mortality and prevalence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prediction models tend to perform better on data on which the model was constructed than on new data. This difference in performance is an indication of the optimism in the apparent performance in the derivation set. For internal model validation, bootstrapping methods are recommended to provide bias-corrected estimates of model performance. Results are often accepted without sufficient regard to the importance of external validation. This report illustrates the limitations of internal validation to determine generalizability of a diagnostic prediction model to future settings.
METHODS: A prediction model for the presence of serious bacterial infections in children with fever without source was derived and validated internally using bootstrap resampling techniques. Subsequently, the model was validated externally.
RESULTS: In the derivation set (n=376), nine predictors were identified. The apparent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95\% confidence interval) of the model was 0.83 (0.78-0.87) and 0.76 (0.67-0.85) after bootstrap correction. In the validation set (n=179) the performance was 0.57 (0.47-0.67).
CONCLUSION: For relatively small data sets, internal validation of prediction models by bootstrap techniques may not be sufficient and indicative for the model's performance in future patients. External validation is essential before implementing prediction models in clinical practice.},

Such evaluation cannot be achieved with studies of real data alone. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex situations seen in practice, such as in prognostic factors studies, is not a simple process. Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided. A small review of the literature identifies the current practices within published simulation studies.},

"Strong calibration" requires that the event rate equals the predicted risk for every covariate pattern. This implies that the model is fully correct for the validation setting. We argue that this is unrealistic: the model type may be incorrect, the linear predictor is only asymptotically unbiased, and all nonlinear and interaction effects should be correctly modeled.

  abstract = {Diagnostic problems in medicine are sometimes polytomous, meaning that the outcome has more than two distinct categories. For example, ovarian tumors can be benign, borderline, primary invasive, or metastatic. Extending the main measure of binary discrimination, the c-statistic or area under the ROC curve, to nominal polytomous settings is not straightforward. This paper reviews existing measures and presents the polytomous discrimination index (PDI) as an alternative. The PDI assesses all sets of k cases consisting of one case from each outcome category. For each category i (i = 1, \ldots{} ,k), it is assessed whether the risk of category i is highest for the case from category i. A score of 1/k is given per category for which this holds, yielding a set score between 0 and 1 to indicate the level of discrimination. The PDI is the average set score and is interpreted as the probability to correctly identify a case from a randomly selected category within a set of k cases. This probability can be split up by outcome category, yielding k category-specific values that result in the PDI when averaged. We demonstrate the measures on two diagnostic problems (residual mass histology after chemotherapy for testicular cancer; diagnosis of ovarian tumors). We compare the behavior of the measures on theoretical data, showing that PDI is more strongly influenced by simultaneous discrimination between all categories than by partial discrimination between pairs of categories. In conclusion, the PDI is attractive because it better matches the requirements of a measure to summarize polytomous discrimination. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

All these patients had complete baseline data and were followed for one year. Demographic and clinical features of these patients were collected. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze prognostic risk factors and establish prognostic model.

Results indicated that model group included 4,453 live PD cases and 371 dead cases. Multivariate survival analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (DM), residual glomerular filtration rate (rGFR), , SBP, Kt/V, high PET type and Alb were independently associated with one-year mortality. Model was statistically significant in both within-group verification and outside-group verification. In conclusion, DM, rGFR, SBP, Kt/V, high PET type and Alb were independent risk factors for short-term mortality in PD patients.

The association of NAFLD with outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been variably reported. This study aimed to investigate the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular, renal outcomes and mortality in patients with advanced DKD (CKD 3-5, not on dialysis).
METHODS: This observational study was carried out on 192 patients with DKD within a cohort of 2,974 non-dialysis CKD patients, who had an ultrasound (US) of their liver done between January 2000 and end of December 2014. From these 192 patients, 149 patients (NAFLD 48 and normal US 101) were included for comparative analysis, as they had complete datasets. Patient demographics, comorbidities and blood results were collected at study baseline. Follow-up data on non-fatal cardiovascular events (NFCVE), mortality and serial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was gathered until study end point. Cox-regression analysis was used to study the association of NAFLD with NFCVE and mortality, and linear regression analysis was used for the estimation of renal progression.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 69 months, similar in both groups (p = 0.09). Median eGFR was 31.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a median urine protein creatinine ratio of 46 g/mol. A total of 20 (41.7\%) NFCVE were recorded in the NAFLD group compared to 14 (13.9\%) in the normal US group. Multivariable Cox-regression analysis showed NAFLD as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio 2.95; 95\% CI 1.31-6.60; p = 0.01) for NFCVE even after including all cardiovascular risks parameters that were significant in the univariable model. There was no significant difference in survival between the 2 groups over the follow-up period (log-rank test, p = 0.76). The overall rate of decline in eGFR was 3.46 mL/min/1.73 m2/year and this was not observed to be~different between the groups (p = 0.65).
CONCLUSION: In~our cohort of patients with advanced DKD, NAFLD showed~a strong independent association with cardiovascular outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to strengthen these associations and plan a strategy for screening NAFLD in this high-risk group.},

Design Prospective cohort study to validate a cardiovascular risk score.
Setting 365 practices from United Kingdom contributing to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database.
Participants 1.58 million patients registered with a general practice between 1 January 1993 and 20 June 2008, aged 35-74 years (9.4 million person years) with 71 465 cardiovascular events.
Main outcome measures First diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic stroke) recorded in general practice records.
Results QRISK2 offered improved prediction of a patient's 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease over the NICE version of the Framingham equation. Discrimination and calibration statistics were better with QRISK2. QRISK2 explained 33\% of the variation in men and 40\% for women, compared with 29\% and 34\% respectively for the NICE Framingham and 32\% and 38\% respectively for QRISK1. The incidence rate of cardiovascular events (per 1000 person years) among men in the high risk group was 27.8 (95\% CI 27.4 to 28.2) with QRISK2, 21.9 (21.6 to 22.2) with NICE Framingham, and 24.8 (22.8 to 26.9) with QRISK1. Similarly, the incidence rate of cardiovascular events (per 1000 person years) among women in the high risk group was 24.3 (23.8 to 24.9) with QRISK2, 20.6 (20.1 to 21.0) with NICE Framingham, and 21.8 (18.9 to 24.6) with QRISK1.
Conclusions QRISK2 is more accurate in identifying a high risk population for cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom than the NICE version of the Framingham equation. Differences in performance between QRISK2 and QRISK1 were marginal.},

  abstract = {Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health concern that is increasing mainly as the result of increasing incidences of diabetes and hypertension. Furthermore, if left untreated, individuals with CKD may progress to end-stage kidney failure. Identifying individuals with undiagnosed CKD or those who are at an increased risk of developing CKD or progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is therefore an important challenge. We sought to systematically review and critically assess the conduct and reporting of methods used to develop risk prediction models for predicting the risk of having undiagnosed (prevalent) or future risk of developing (incident) CKD or end-stage kidney failure in adults.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search of PubMed database to identify studies published up until September 2011 that describe the development of models combining two or more variables to predict the risk of prevalent or incident CKD or ESKD. We extracted key information that describes aspects of developing a prediction model, including the study design, data quality, sample size and number of events, outcome definition, risk predictor selection and coding, missing data, model-building strategies, and aspects of performance.
Results
Eleven studies describing the development of 14 prediction models were included. Eight studies reported the development of 11 models to predict incident CKD or ESKD, whereas 3 studies developed models for prevalent CKD. A total of 97 candidate risk predictors were considered, and 43 different risk predictors featured in the 14 prediction models. A method, not recommended to select risk predictors for inclusion in the multivariate model, using statistical significance from univariate screening was carried out in six studies. Missing data were frequently poorly handled and reported with no mention of missing data in four studies; 4 studies explicitly excluded individuals with missing data, and only 2 studies used multiple imputation to replace missing values.
Conclusion
We found that prediction models for chronic kidney were often developed using inappropriate methods and were generally poorly reported. Using poor methods can affect the predictive ability of the models, whereas inadequate reporting hinders an objective evaluation of the potential usefulness of the model.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).},

Methods for testing and visualizing calibration (e.g., the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration slope) have been well thought out in the binary regression setting. However, extension of these methods to Cox models are less well-known, and could be improved. We describe a model-based framework for assessment of calibration in the binary setting that provides natural extensions to the survival data setting. We show that Poisson regression models can be used to easily assess calibration in prognostic models. In addition, we show that a calibration test suggested for use in survival data has poor performance. Finally, we apply these methods to the problem of external validation of a risk score developed for the general population when assessed in a special patient population (i.e., patients with particular comorbidities, such as rheumatoid arthritis).},

  abstract = {Continuous variables (such as intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, contrast sensitivity) are commonly measured in clinical ophthalmology and vision research. In clinical practice, a `status' (category) can sometimes be assigned to an individual patient using a cutpoint in the value of a continuous variable; for example, a diagnosis of glaucoma might be confirmed by an elevated IOP measurement (eg, IOP {$>$}21\hspace{0.25em}mm\hspace{0.25em}Hg). Indeed much of medicine revolves around an implicit classification of individuals into diseased and non-diseased. In clinical research, continuous variables may likewise be converted to categorical variables, assigning individuals to one of two groups. Although this may be appropriate for some specific studies where the underlying distribution of the variable shows a clear grouping, such dichotomisation has several drawbacks.1

Dichotomisation may be driven by the research question, for example, a study to investigate the health service needs of those with low vision, in which dichotomisation uses WHO visual acuity threshold for low vision.2 It may sometimes be used to bring the data in line with the clinical classification of patients but often the reason for dichotomisation of data is that it is thought to simplify the statistical analysis (eg, to enable use of a t test or a {$\chi$}2 test) and the presentation and interpretation of data. However, this simplification has a cost in terms of loss of information3 and may compromise the validity of the statistical analysis. We will discuss the disadvantages of dichotomisation and outline some points to consider before categorising continuous data. It should be noted that while the focus here is on categorisation of data into two groups, the problems arising when dichotomising data are inherent with any categorisation of data (two or more groups).

Dichotomisation results, first, in the loss of descriptive information on the study population. For example, the \ldots{}},

Many CKD G4+ patients are older with multiple comorbidities, which may distort associations between risk factors and clinical outcomes.
Methods: We undertook a meta-analysis of risk factors for kidney failure treated with kidney replacement therapy (KRT), cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and death in participants with CKD G4+ from 28 cohorts (n~= 185,024) across the world who were part of the CKD Prognosis Consortium.
Results: In the fully adjusted meta-analysis, risk factors associated with KRT were time-varying CVD, male sex, black race, diabetes, lower eGFR, and higher albuminuria and systolic blood pressure. Age was associated with a lower risk of KRT (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.74; 95\% confidence interval: 0.69-0.80) overall, and also in the subgroup of individuals younger than 65 years. The risk factors for CVD events included male sex, history of CVD, diabetes, lower eGFR, higher albuminuria, and the onset of KRT. Systolic blood pressure showed a U-shaped association with CVD events. Risk factors for mortality were similar to those for CVD events but also included smoking. Most risk factors had qualitatively consistent associations across cohorts.
Conclusion: Traditional CVD risk factors are of prognostic value in individuals with an eGFR~{$<$}30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, although the risk estimates vary for kidney and CVD outcomes. These results should encourage interventional studies on correcting risk factors in this high-risk population.},

  abstract = {With explanatory covariates, the standard analysis for competing risks data involves modeling the cause-specific hazard functions via a proportional hazards assumption. Unfortunately, the cause-specific hazard function does not have a direct interpretation in terms of survival probabilities for the particular failure type. In recent years many clinicians have begun using the cumulative incidence function, the marginal failure probabilities for a particular cause, which is intuitively appealing and more easily explained to the nonstatistician. The cumulative incidence is especially relevant in cost-effectiveness analyses in which the survival probabilities are needed to determine treatment utility. Previously, authors have considered methods for combining estimates of the cause-specific hazard functions under the proportional hazards formulation. However, these methods do not allow the analyst to directly assess the effect of a covariate on the marginal probability function. In this article we propose a novel semiparametric proportional hazards model for the subdistribution. Using the partial likelihood principle and weighting techniques, we derive estimation and inference procedures for the finite-dimensional regression parameter under a variety of censoring scenarios. We give a uniformly consistent estimator for the predicted cumulative incidence for an individual with certain covariates; confidence intervals and bands can be obtained analytically or with an easy-to-implement simulation technique. To contrast the two approaches, we analyze a dataset from a breast cancer clinical trial under both models.},

Here we applied a modified Framingham Heart Study approach to derive 1- and 2-year all-cause mortality risk scores using a 11,508 European incident HD patient database (AROii) recruited between 2007 and 2009. This scoring model was validated externally using similar-sized Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Survey (DOPPS) data. For AROii, the observed 1- and 2-year mortality rates were 13.0 (95\% confidence interval (CI; 12.3-13.8)) and 11.2 (10.4-12.1)/100 patient years, respectively. Increasing age, low body mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or cancer, and use of a vascular access catheter during baseline were consistent predictors of mortality. Among baseline laboratory markers, hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and creatinine predicted death within 1 and 2 years. When applied to the DOPPS population, the predictive risk score models were highly discriminatory, and generalizability remained high when restricted by incidence/prevalence and geographic location (C-statistics 0.68-0.79). This new model offers improved predictive power over age/comorbidity-based models and also predicted early mortality (C-statistic 0.71). Our new model delivers a robust and reproducible mortality risk score, based on readily available clinical and laboratory data.},

The degree of renal recovery from AKI may substantially affect these long-term endpoints. Therefore maximising recovery of renal function should be the goal of any AKI prevention and treatment strategy. Defining renal recovery is far from straightforward due in part to the limitations of the tests available to assess renal function. Here, we discuss common pitfalls in the evaluation of renal recovery and provide suggestions for improved assessment in the future. We review the epidemiology of renal recovery and of the association between AKI and the development of CKD. Finally, we stress the importance of post-discharge follow-up of AKI patients and make suggestions for its incorporation into clinical practice. Summary key points are that risk factors for non-recovery of AKI are age, CKD, comorbidity, higher severity of AKI and acute disease scores. Second, AKI and CKD are mutually related and seem to have a common denominator. Third, despite its limitations full recovery of AKI may best be defined as the absence of AKI criteria, and partial recovery as a fall in AKI stage. Fourth, after an episode of AKI, serial follow-up measurements of serum creatinine and proteinuria are warranted to diagnose renal impairment and prevent further progression. Measures to promote recovery are similar to those preventing renal harm. Specific interventions promoting repair are still experimental.},

  abstract = {Background
The interest in prognostic reviews is increasing, but to properly review existing evidence an accurate search filer for finding prediction research is needed. The aim of this paper was to validate and update two previously introduced search filters for finding prediction research in Medline: the Ingui filter and the Haynes Broad filter.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Based on a hand search of 6 general journals in 2008 we constructed two sets of papers. Set 1 consisted of prediction research papers (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}71), and set 2 consisted of the remaining papers (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1133). Both search filters were validated in two ways, using diagnostic accuracy measures as performance measures. First, we compared studies in set 1 (reference) with studies retrieved by the search strategies as applied in Medline. Second, we compared studies from 4 published systematic reviews (reference) with studies retrieved by the search filter as applied in Medline. Next \textendash{} using word frequency methods \textendash{} we constructed an additional search string for finding prediction research. Both search filters were good in identifying clinical prediction models: sensitivity ranged from 0.94 to 1.0 using our hand search as reference, and 0.78 to 0.89 using the systematic reviews as reference. This latter performance measure even increased to around 0.95 (range 0.90 to 0.97) when either search filter was combined with the additional string that we developed. Retrieval rate of explorative prediction research was poor, both using our hand search or our systematic review as reference, and even combined with our additional search string: sensitivity ranged from 0.44 to 0.85.

Conclusions/Significance
Explorative prediction research is difficult to find in Medline, using any of the currently available search filters. Yet, application of either the Ingui filter or the Haynes broad filter results in a very low number missed clinical prediction model studies.},

  abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ={$\not$} F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

Risk prediction models provide a useful clinical and research framework for forecasting the probability of adverse events and stratifying patients with CKD according to risk; however, accurate absolute risk prediction requires careful model specification. Competing events that preclude the event of interest (for example, death in studies of end-stage renal disease) must be taken into account. Functional forms of predictor variables and underlying effect modification must be accurately specified; nonlinearity and possible interactions should be evaluated. The potential effect of measurement error should also be considered. Misspecification of any of these components can dramatically affect absolute risk prediction. Evaluation of prognostic models should encompass not only traditional tests of calibration and discrimination, such as the Hosmer-Lemeshow test of 'goodness of fit' and the area under the receiver operating curve, but also newer metrics, such as risk reclassification tables and net reclassification indices. The latter two tests are particularly useful when considering the addition of novel predictors to established models. Finally, models of absolute risk prediction should be internally and externally validated as they typically generalize only to populations with similar baseline characteristics and rates of competing events.},

Accurate estimates of risk and timing of these clinical outcomes could guide patient counseling and therapy.

Median participant eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were 24 ml/min/1.73m2 and 168 mg/g, respectively.

Hypothetically applied to a 60-year-old white male with a history of CVD, a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg, an eGFR of 25 ml/min/1.73m2 and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 1000 mg/g, the four-year model predicted a 17\% chance of survival after KRT, a 17\% chance of survival after a CVD event, a 4\% chance of survival after both, and a 28\% chance of death (9\% as a first event, and 19\% after another CVD event or KRT). Risk predictions for KRT showed good overall agreement with the published kidney failure risk equation, and both models were well calibrated with observed risk. Thus, commonly-measured clinical characteristics can predict the timing and occurrence of clinical outcomes in patients with severely decreased GFR.},

  abstract = {Background
There is no single model available to predict the long term survival for patients starting renal replacement therapy (RRT). The available models either predict survival on dialysis until transplantation, survival on the transplant waiting list, or survival after transplantation. The aim of this study was to develop a model that includes dialysis survival and survival after an eventual transplantation.

Methods
From the Dutch renal replacement registry, patients of 16~years of age or older were included if they started RRT between 1995 and 2005, still underwent RRT at baseline (90~days after the start of RRT) and were not registered at a non-renal organ transplant waiting list (N\,=\,13868). A prediction model of 10-year patient survival after baseline was developed through multivariate Cox regression analysis, in one half of the research group. Age at start, sex, primary renal disease (PRD) and therapy at baseline were included as possible predictors. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine whether listing on the transplant waiting list should be added. The predictive performance of the model was internally validated. Calibration and discrimination were computed in the other half of the research group. Another sensitivity analysis was to assess whether the outcomes differed if the model was developed and tested in two geographical regions, which were less similar than the original development and validation group. No external validation has been performed.

Results
Survival probabilities were influenced by age, sex, PRD and therapy at baseline (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The calibration and discrimination both showed very reasonable results for the prediction model (C-index\,=\,0.720 and calibration slope for the prognostic index\,=\,1.025, for the 10~year survival). Adding registration on the waiting list for renal transplantation as a predictor did not improve the discriminative power of the model and was therefore not included in the model.

Conclusions
With the presented prediction model, it is possible to give a reasonably accurate estimation on the survival chances of patients who start with RRT, using a limited set of easily available data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To derive a new cardiovascular disease risk score (QRISK) for the United Kingdom and to validate its performance against the established Framingham cardiovascular disease algorithm and a newly developed Scottish score (ASSIGN).
DESIGN: Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from general practice.
SETTING: UK practices contributing to the QRESEARCH database.
PARTICIPANTS: The derivation cohort consisted of 1.28 million patients, aged 35-74 years, registered at 318 practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007 and who were free of diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The validation cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (incident diagnosis between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007): myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attacks. Risk factors were age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol to high density lipoprotein, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative aged less than 60, area measure of deprivation, and existing treatment with antihypertensive agent.
RESULTS: A cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK) was developed in the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort the observed 10 year risk of a cardiovascular event was 6.60\% (95\% confidence interval 6.48\% to 6.72\%) in women and 9.28\% (9.14\% to 9.43\%) in men. Overall the Framingham algorithm over-predicted cardiovascular disease risk at 10 years by 35\%, ASSIGN by 36\%, and QRISK by 0.4\%. Measures of discrimination tended to be higher for QRISK than for the Framingham algorithm and it was better calibrated to the UK population than either the Framingham or ASSIGN models. Using QRISK 8.5\% of patients aged 35-74 are at high risk (20\% risk or higher over 10 years) compared with 13\% when using the Framingham algorithm and 14\% when using ASSIGN. Using QRISK 34\% of women and 73\% of men aged 64-75 would be at high risk compared with 24\% and 86\% according to the Framingham algorithm. UK estimates for 2005 based on QRISK give 3.2 million patients aged 35-74 at high risk, with the Framingham algorithm predicting 4.7 million and ASSIGN 5.1 million. Overall, 53 668 patients in the validation dataset (9\% of the total) would be reclassified from high to low risk or vice versa using QRISK compared with the Framingham algorithm.
CONCLUSION: QRISK performed at least as well as the Framingham model for discrimination and was better calibrated to the UK population than either the Framingham model or ASSIGN. QRISK is likely to provide more appropriate risk estimates to help identify high risk patients on the basis of age, sex, and social deprivation. It is therefore likely to be a more equitable tool to inform management decisions and help ensure treatments are directed towards those most likely to benefit. It includes additional variables which improve risk estimates for patients with a positive family history or those on antihypertensive treatment. However, since the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further validation in other populations is therefore required.},

  abstract = {Objectives To develop and validate updated QRISK3 prediction algorithms to estimate the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in women and men accounting for potential new risk factors.
Design Prospective open cohort study.
Setting General practices in England providing data for the QResearch database.
Participants 1309 QResearch general practices in England: 981 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 328 practices were used to validate the scores. 7.89 million patients aged 25-84 years were in the derivation cohort and 2.67 million patients in the validation cohort. Patients were free of cardiovascular disease and not prescribed statins at baseline.
Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years. Risk factors considered included those already in QRISK2 (age, ethnicity, deprivation, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol: high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, smoking, family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5)) and new risk factors (chronic kidney disease (stage 3, 4, or 5), a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and HIV/AIDs). We also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status.
Main outcome measures Incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources: general practice, mortality, or hospital admission records.
Results 363 565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for HIV/AIDS, which was not statistically significant. The models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the algorithm explained 59.6\% of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (R2, with higher values indicating more variation), and the D statistic was 2.48 and Harrell's C statistic was 0.88 (both measures of discrimination, with higher values indicating better discrimination). The corresponding values for men were 54.8\%, 2.26, and 0.86. Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was similar to the QRISK2 algorithms.
Conclusion Updated QRISK3 risk prediction models were developed and validated. The inclusion of additional clinical variables in QRISK3 (chronic kidney disease, a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, SLE, atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and erectile dysfunction) can help enable doctors to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowing how kidney disease progresses is important for decision making in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for designing clinical services.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: We examined renal function trajectories in CRISIS (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study), in which 1,325 patients with CKD stages 3-5 and mean age of 65.1 years were followed up prospectively for a median of 26 months after referral to a regional nephrology center in the United Kingdom. By protocol, estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined every 12 months.
PREDICTORS: CKD stage defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate {$\geq$} 45 (stage 3a), 30-44 (3b), 15-29 (4), and {$<$} 15 (5) mL/min/1.73 m{$^2$}.
OUTCOMES: Onset of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, the composite end point of RRT or death, or decreasing CKD stage.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 26 months, 13\% reached the end point of RRT (5.1 events/100 patient-years), 20\% died (9.6 deaths/100 patient-years), and 33\% reached the combined end point of RRT or death (14.7 events/100 patient-years). For stage 3a, baseline prevalence and annual probabilities of decreasing CKD stage, RRT, and death were 18.0\%, 0.41, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. Corresponding values for stage 3b were 32.5\%, 0.22, {$<$} 0.01, and 0.06; for stage 4, 36.5\%, 0.17, 0.03, and 0.10; and for stage 5, 13.2\%, zero (by definition), 0.31, and 0.08, respectively. Markov model projections suggested a steady decrease for proportions with stages 3a, 3b, and 4; a steady increase for death and RRT; and a biphasic pattern for (non-RRT) stage 5, with a plateau in the first 2 years followed by a steady decrease.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center observational study.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that death and RRT are the dominant outcomes in patients referred for management of CKD and that most patients spend comparatively little time in late stages without RRT.},

Despite renewed interest in the their use, inconsistent terminology makes them difficult to index and retrieve by computerized search systems. No validated approaches to locating clinical prediction rules appear in the literature. The objective of this study was to derive and validate an optimal search filter for retrieving clinical prediction rules, using the National Library of Medicine's medline database., Design: A comparative, retrospective analysis was conducted. The ``gold standard'' was established by a manual search of all articles from select print journals for the years 1991 through 1998, which identified articles covering various aspects of clinical prediction rules such as derivation, validation, and evaluation. Search filters were derived, from the articles in the July through December issues of the journals (derivation set), by analyzing the textwords (words in the title and abstract) and the medical subject heading (from the MeSH Thesaurus) used to index each article. The accuracy of these filters in retrieving clinical prediction rules was then assessed using articles in the January through June issues (validation set)., Measurements: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio of several different search filters were measured., Results: The filter ``predict\$ OR clinical\$ OR outcome\$ OR risk\$'' retrieved 98 percent of clinical prediction rules. Four filters, such as ``predict\$ OR validat\$ OR rule\$ OR predictive value of tests,'' had both sensitivity and specificity above 90 percent. The top-performing filter for positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio in the validation set was ``predict\$.ti. AND rule\$.'', Conclusions: Several filters with high retrieval value were found. Depending on the goals and time constraints of the searcher, one of these filters could be used.},

The practice is prevalent, but its effects are not well understood. In this article, the authors present historical results on the effects of dichotomization of normal predictor variables rederived in a regression context that may be more relevant to marketing researchers. The authors then present new results on the effect of dichotomizing continuous predictor variables with various nonnormal distributions and examine the effects of dichotomization on model specification and fit in multiple regression. The authors conclude that dichotomization has only negative consequences and should be avoided.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction models combine patient characteristics and test results to predict the presence of a disease or the occurrence of an event in the future. In the event that test results (predictor) are unavailable, a strategy is needed to help users applying a prediction model to deal with such missing values. We evaluated 6 strategies to deal with missing values.
METHODS: We developed and validated (in 1295 and 532 primary care patients, respectively) a prediction model to predict the risk of deep venous thrombosis. In an application set (259 patients), we mimicked 3 situations in which (1) an important predictor (D-dimer test), (2) a weaker predictor (difference in calf circumference), and (3) both predictors simultaneously were missing. The 6 strategies to deal with missing values were (1) ignoring the predictor, (2) overall mean imputation, (3) subgroup mean imputation, (4) multiple imputation, (5) applying a submodel including only the observed predictors as derived from the development set, or (6) the "one-step-sweep" method. We compared the model's discriminative ability (expressed by the ROC area) with the true ROC area (no missing values) and the model's estimated calibration slope and intercept with the ideal values of 1 and 0, respectively.
RESULTS: Ignoring the predictor led to the worst and multiple imputation to the best discrimination. Multiple imputation led to calibration intercepts closest to the true value. The effect of the strategies on the slope differed between the 3 scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple imputation is preferred if a predictor value is missing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prognostic risk scores can help clinicians intervene on higher risk patients and counsel them. Our objective is to identify characteristics that predict the rate of progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT) and evaluate how those characteristics predict mortality and a composite end point (RRT and mortality).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: We conducted the study at Kaiser Permanente Northwest, a health maintenance organization. We followed up members with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that indicated chronic kidney disease (2 eGFRs {$<$} 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [{$<$}1.0 mL/s/1.73 m(2)] at least 90 days apart).
PREDICTORS: We measured baseline clinical characteristics between January 1997 and June 2000 by using electronic medical records and patients' histories of hospitalization.
OUTCOMES \& MEASUREMENTS: We calculated adjusted hazard ratios and concordance statistics for progression to RRT, mortality, and the composite by using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 6,541) were followed up for up to 5 years. We observed 1.6 progressions to RRT/100 person-years and 11.4 deaths/100 person-years. The 6 characteristics of age, sex, eGFR, diabetes, hypertension, and anemia predicted RRT effectively (c statistic, 0.91). However, hypertension and age predicted in the opposite direction for mortality and its composite end point. The c statistic decreased: mortality (0.70), mortality and RRT (0.71).
LIMITATIONS: Characteristics were measured without a protocol; extensive missing data prevented the evaluation of known risk factors (eg, proteinuria).
CONCLUSIONS: Predicting RRT effectively requires a separate risk score. Predicting the composite end point would favor characteristics that predict mortality because it is 7 times as common as RRT.},

We developed a risk score to predict the 5-year risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: Participants were members of a health maintenance organization and met Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative criteria for stage 3 or 4 CKD during 1999 or 2000: two estimated glomerular filtration rate values of 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
PREDICTOR: Characteristics collected during routine clinical practice.
OUTCOMES \& MEASUREMENTS: We ascertained the onset of RRT (dialysis or kidney transplantation) using the health maintenance organization databases. Cox regression predicted patient risk of RRT and generated a risk scoring system.
RESULTS: 9,782 patients experienced a 3.3\% five-year progression to RRT (95\% confidence interval, 2.9 to 3.7). Using 6 characteristics (age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, anemia, and hypertension), the risk score discriminated the highest risk patients effectively: 19.0\% of patients in the highest risk quintile experienced progression, and 0.2\% of patients in the lowest risk quintile experienced progression. The c statistic also showed effective discrimination: 0.89 on a scale of 0.5 to 1.0. Predicted and observed risks agreed within 1.0\%--effective calibration. We present a range of predicted risk cutoff values from 1\% to 20\% and their test properties for decision makers' consideration.
LIMITATIONS: Characteristics were measured without a protocol.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk score can help providers identify patients with CKD at the highest risk of progression to improve referral to nephrology for comanagement. A separate risk score for mortality also is needed.},

The aging of populations carries over to clinical research and leads to an increasing representation of elderly and multimorbid individuals in study populations. Clinical research in these populations is complicated by the fact that individuals are likely to experience several potential disease endpoints that prevent some disease-specific endpoint of interest from occurrence. Large developments in competing risks methodology have been achieved over the last decades, but we assume that recognition of competing risks in the clinical community is still marginal. It is the aim of this article to address translational aspects of competing risks to the clinical community. We describe clinical populations where competing risks issues may arise. We then discuss the importance of agreement between the competing risks methodology and the study aim, in particular the distinction between etiologic and prognostic research questions. In a review of 50 clinical studies performed in individuals susceptible to competing risks published in high-impact clinical journals, we found competing risks issues in 70\% of all articles. Better recognition of issues related to competing risks and of statistical methods that deal with competing risks in accordance with the aim of the study is needed.},

  abstract = {eGFR is a robust predictor of ESRD risk. However, the prognostic information gained from the past trajectory (slope) beyond that of the current eGFR is unclear. We examined 22 cohorts to determine the association of past slopes and current eGFR level with subsequent ESRD. We modeled hazard ratios as a spline function of slopes, adjusting for demographic variables, eGFR, and comorbidities. We used random effects meta\textendash{}analyses to combine results across studies stratified by cohort type. We calculated the absolute risk of ESRD at 5 years after the last eGFR using the weighted average baseline risk. Overall, 1,080,223 participants experienced 5163 ESRD events during a mean follow-up of 2.0 years. In CKD cohorts, a slope of -6 versus 0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year over the previous 3 years (a decline of 18 ml/min per 1.73 m2 versus no decline) associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of ESRD of 2.28 (95\% confidence interval, 1.88 to 2.76). In contrast, a current eGFR of 30 versus 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (a difference of 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2) associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 19.9 (95\% confidence interval, 13.6 to 29.1). Past decline contributed more to the absolute risk of ESRD at lower than higher levels of current eGFR. In conclusion, during a follow-up of 2 years, current eGFR associates more strongly with future ESRD risk than the magnitude of past eGFR decline, but both contribute substantially to the risk of ESRD, especially at eGFR{$<$}30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.},

Unknown is how changes in these covariates after listing impact transplant outcomes. Methods Two cohorts were created from the OPTN (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) database, one pre-KAS (new kidney allocation system) (10/01/2009-12/04/2013, n = 97,793) and one post-KAS (12/04/2014-06/17/2015, n = 13,113).

Results Transition probabilities show chances of converting between intermediate states prior to a competing-risk outcome.

Post-KAS, Whites had a statistically higher transplant probability only at a CPRA of 99\textendash{}100\%. Conclusion Multi-state modeling provides transition probabilities between CPRA/activity status combinations, giving estimates on how changing patient characteristic's after listing impact outcomes. Preliminarily, across most CPRA categories, there was no statistical difference in transplant probabilities between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics following KAS implementation, however, this finding requires longer follow-up for validation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Validated prediction scores are required to assess the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with validation in a separate cohort.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: Cox regression was used to assess the relevance of baseline characteristics to risk of ESRD (mean follow-up, 4.1 years) and death (mean follow-up, 6.0 years) in 382 patients with stages 3-5 CKD not initially on dialysis therapy in the Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham (CRIB) Study. Resultant risk prediction equations were tested in a separate cohort of 213 patients with CKD (the East Kent cohort).
FACTORS: 44 baseline characteristics (including 30 blood and urine assays).
OUTCOMES: ESRD and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: In the CRIB cohort, 190 patients reached ESRD (12.1\%/y) and 150 died (6.5\%/y). Each 30\% lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with a 3-fold higher ESRD rate and a 1.3-fold higher death rate. After adjustment for each other, only baseline creatinine level, serum phosphate level, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, and female sex remained strongly (P {$<$} 0.01) predictive of ESRD. For death, age, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, troponin T level, and cigarette smoking remained strongly predictive of risk. Using these factors to predict outcomes in the East Kent cohort yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ie, C statistic) of 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.87-0.96) for ESRD and 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.75-0.89) for death.
LIMITATIONS: Other important factors may have been missed because of limited study power.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple laboratory measures of kidney and cardiac function plus age, sex, and smoking history can be used to help identify patients with CKD at highest risk of ESRD and death. Larger cohort studies are required to further validate these results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are routinely used to assess kidney function. Current equations have limited precision and systematically underestimate measured GFR at higher values.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new estimating equation for GFR: the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis with separate pooled data sets for equation development and validation and a representative sample of the U.S. population for prevalence estimates.
SETTING: Research studies and clinical populations ("studies") with measured GFR and NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1999 to 2006.
PARTICIPANTS: 8254 participants in 10 studies (equation development data set) and 3896 participants in 16 studies (validation data set). Prevalence estimates were based on 16,032 participants in NHANES.
MEASUREMENTS: GFR, measured as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (iothalamate in the development data set; iothalamate and other markers in the validation data set), and linear regression to estimate the logarithm of measured GFR from standardized creatinine levels, sex, race, and age.
RESULTS: In the validation data set, the CKD-EPI equation performed better than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, especially at higher GFR (P {$<$} 0.001 for all subsequent comparisons), with less bias (median difference between measured and estimated GFR, 2.5 vs. 5.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), improved precision (interquartile range [IQR] of the differences, 16.6 vs. 18.3 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), and greater accuracy (percentage of estimated GFR within 30\% of measured GFR, 84.1\% vs. 80.6\%). In NHANES, the median estimated GFR was 94.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR, 79.7 to 108.1) vs. 85.0 (IQR, 72.9 to 98.5) mL/min per 1.73 m(2), and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11.5\% (95\% CI, 10.6\% to 12.4\%) versus 13.1\% (CI, 12.1\% to 14.0\%).
LIMITATION: The sample contained a limited number of elderly people and racial and ethnic minorities with measured GFR.
CONCLUSION: The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and could replace it for routine clinical use.

  abstract = {This paper uses a non-parametric test, based on consistently estimated discrimination accuracy defined as concordance probability between quantitative predictor and outcome, to compare paired biomarkers in predicting a health outcome, possibly subject to random censoring. Comparing with the Wilcoxon test for paired predictors based on Harrell's C-index, we found that the proposed test is better in presence of random censoring, although the two unbiased tests are equivalent for outcome either uncensored or censored by a constant. A simulation study also demonstrates that the bias in estimated difference in concordance probability, due to ignoring random censoring, results in overestimated power, especially when random censoring is heavy. The method was applied in two studies, where the biomarkers measured from the same study subjects are correlated. The first study on 299 school children in Bangladesh found the associations that higher blood arsenic and manganese were related to lower intellectual test scores, while the differences between the biomarkers in predicting the intellectual test scores were not statistically significant. The second study on 418 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis found that the baseline serum bilirubin had greater discrimination accuracy than the baseline serum albumin in predicting survival time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients have an increased risk of skin cancers. A specialist dermatology clinic for renal transplant recipients (RTRs) was established in 2005.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the type and incidence of skin cancers in prevalent patients in the West of Scotland after renal transplant, and to analyse the impact of the time since transplant and the immunosuppression regimen.
METHODS: Skin cancer data for RTRs attending the transplant dermatology clinic over a 38-month period were collected and recorded in the West of Scotland electronic renal patient record. Skin cancer data were intrinsically linked to each individual's transplant and immunosuppression data.
RESULTS: Overall, 610 patients attended. The median follow-up time from the date of first transplant was 10 years. Ninety-three patients (15.2\%) had experienced a total of 368 skin cancers since transplant, and the prevalence increased with time since transplant. Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) occurred in 74 patients (12.1\%) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in 42 patients (6.9\%). Three patients (0.5\%) had experienced a melanoma. The SCC:BCC ratio was 0.7. Survival analysis showed significant reduction in the time to develop skin cancer in patients transplanted from 1995 onwards (P {$<$} 0.0001) and in patients who had been on triple immunosuppressant therapy at 1 year after transplant, compared with dual therapy (P {$<$} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of skin cancer in prevalent Scottish RTRs. The incidence of skin cancer is high and appears to have a direct relationship to the overall burden of immunosuppression. The SCC:BCC ratio, which is lower than reports from other centres, deserves further scrutiny.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard survival analysis fails to give insight into what happens to a patient after a first outcome event (like first relapse of a disease). Multi-state models are a useful tool for analyzing survival data when different treatments and results (intermediate events) can occur. Aim of this study was to implement a multi-state model on data of patients with rectal cancer to illustrate the advantages of multi-state analysis in comparison to standard survival analysis.
Methods: We re-analyzed data from the RCT FOGT-2 study by using a multi-state model. Based on the results we defined a high and low risk reference patient. Using dynamic prediction, we estimated how the survival probability changes as more information about the clinical history of the patient becomes available.
Results: A patient with stage UICC IIIc (vs UICC II) has a higher risk to develop distant metastasis (DM) or both DM and local recurrence (LR) if he/she discontinues chemotherapy within 6 months or between 6 and 12 months, as well as after the completion of 12 months CTx with HR 3.55 (p = 0.026), 5.33 (p = 0.001) and 3. 37 (p {$<$} 0.001), respectively. He/she also has a higher risk to die after the development of DM (HR 1.72, p = 0. 023). Anterior resection vs. abdominoperineal amputation means 63\% risk reduction to develop DM or both DM and LR (HR 0.37, p = 0.003) after discontinuation of chemotherapy between 6 and 12 months. After development of LR, a woman has a 4.62 times higher risk to die (p = 0.006). A high risk reference patient has an estimated 43\% 5-year survival probability at start of CTx, whereas for a low risk patient this is 79\%. After the development of DM 1 year later, the high risk patient has an estimated 5-year survival probability of 11\% and the low risk patient one of 21\%.
Conclusions: Multi-state models help to gain additional insight into the complex events after start of treatment. Dynamic prediction shows how survival probabilities change by progression of the clinical history.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and important due to poor outcomes. An ability to stratify CKD care based on outcome risk should improve care for all. Our objective was to develop and validate 5-year outcome prediction tools in a large population-based CKD cohort. Model performance was compared with the recently reported 'kidney failure risk equation' (KFRE) models.
METHODS: Those with CKD in the Grampian Laboratory Outcomes Mortality and Morbidity Study-I (3396) and -II (18 687) cohorts were used to develop and validate a renal replacement therapy (RRT) prediction tool. The discrimination, calibration and overall performance were assessed. The net reclassification index compared performance of the developed model and the 3- and 4-variable KFRE model to predict RRT in the validation cohort.
RESULTS: The developed model (with measures of age, sex, excretory renal function and proteinuria) performed well with a C-statistic of 0.938 (0.918-0.957) and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) {$\chi$}(2) statistic 4.6. In the validation cohort (18 687), the developed model falsely identified fewer as high risk (414 versus 3278 individuals) compared with the KFRE 3-variable model (measures of age, sex and excretory renal function), but had more false negatives (58 versus 21 individuals). The KFRE 4-variable model could only be applied to 2274 individuals because of a lack of baseline urinary albumin creatinine ratio data, thus limiting its use in routine clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: CKD outcome prediction tools have been developed by ourselves and others. These tools could be used to stratify care, but identify both false positives and -negatives. Further refinement should optimize the balance between identifying those at increased risk with clinical utility for stratifying care.},

  abstract = {In medical studies, there is interest in inferring the marginal distribution of a survival time subject to competing risks. The Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS) was a clinical study for hypercholesterolemia, where pravastatin treatment was compared with conventional treatment. The primary endpoint was time to events of coronary heart disease (CHD). In this study, however, some subjects died from causes other than CHD or were censored due to loss to follow-up. Because the treatments were targeted to reduce CHD events, the investigators were interested in the effect of the treatment on CHD events in the absence of causes of death or events other than CHD. In this paper, we present a method for estimating treatment group-specific marginal survival curves of time-to-event data in the presence of dependent competing risks. The proposed method is a straightforward extension of the Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (IPCW) method to settings with more than one reason for censoring. The results of our analysis showed that the IPCW marginal incidence for CHD was almost the same as the lower bound for which subjects with competing events were assumed to be censored at the end of all follow-up. This result provided reassurance that the results in KLIS were robust to competing risks. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {AIMS: This study aims to examine predictors of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Individuals with the triad of diabetes, CKD, and anemia represent a significant proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease and are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Cox proportional hazards models, we identified independent predictors of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, or heart failure (HF) in 3,847 patients in the TREAT, 961 (25\%) of whom experienced this outcome. The predictors (ranked by {$\chi$}(2) value) were prior HF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.74, 95\% CI 1.51-2.01), age (HR 1.03, 95\% CI 1.02-1.04 per year), log urine protein/creatinine ratio (HR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.13-1.26 per log unit ), C-reactive protein {$\geq$}6.6 mg/L (HR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.23-1.69, compared with C-reactive protein {$\leq$}3.0 mg/L), and abnormal electrocardiogram (HR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.21-1.66 ), all P {$<$} .0001. Addition of cardiac-derived biomarkers (subset of first 1,000 patients enrolled) significantly enhanced risk estimation, with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide becoming the highest ranked predictor of outcome (HR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.15-1.46 per log unit, P {$<$} .001) and troponin T providing additional predictive information. These biomarkers improved risk classification in 17.8\% (9.4\%-26.2\%) of patients.
CONCLUSION: In patients with diabetes, CKD, and anemia, cardiovascular risk is most strongly predicted by age, history of HF, C-reactive protein, urinary protein/creatinine ratio, abnormal electrocardiogram, and 2 specific cardiac biomarkers, serum N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T, which are elevated in many. These findings suggest ways to improve cardiovascular risk stratification of patients with predialysis CKD, support the concept of cardiorenal syndrome, and may help target therapy.},

In some studies, however, the ``alive'' state may be partitioned into two or more intermediate (transient) states, each of which corresponding to a particular stage of the illness. In such studies, multi-state models can be used to model the movement of patients among the various states. In these models issues, of interest include the estimation of progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, survival rates or prognostic forecasting. In this article, we review modelling approaches for multi-state models, and we focus on the estimation of quantities such as the transition probabilities and survival probabilities. Differences between these approaches are discussed, focussing on possible advantages and disadvantages for each method. We also review the existing software currently available to fit the various models and present new software developed in the form of an R library to analyse such models. Different approaches and software are illustrated using data from the Stanford heart transplant study and data from a study on breast cancer conducted in Galicia, Spain.},

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some ``truth'' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

  abstract = {In medical research analyses, continuous variables are often converted into categoric variables by grouping values into {$\geq$}2 categories. The simplicity achieved by creating {$\geq$}2 artificial groups has a cost: Grouping may create rather than avoid problems. In particular, dichotomization leads to a considerable loss of power and incomplete correction for confounding factors. The use of data-derived "optimal" cut-points can lead to serious bias and should at least be tested on independent observations to assess their validity. Both problems are illustrated by the way the results of a registry on unruptured intracranial aneurysms are commonly used. Extreme caution should restrict the application of such results to clinical decision-making. Categorization of continuous data, especially dichotomization, is unnecessary for statistical analysis. Continuous explanatory variables should be left alone in statistical models.},

  abstract = {Background: Prognostic models incorporating survival analysis predict the risk (i.e., probability) of experiencing a future event over a specific time period. In 2002, Royston and Parmar described a type of flexible parametric survival model called the Royston-Parmar model in Statistics in Medicine, a model which fits a restricted cubic spline to flexibly model the baseline log cumulative hazard on the proportional hazards scale. This feature permits absolute measures of effect (e.g., hazard rates) to be estimated at all time points, an important feature when using the model. The Royston-Parmar model can also incorporate time-dependent effects and be used on different scales (e.g., proportional odds, probit). These features make the Royston-Parmar model attractive for prediction, yet their current uptake for prognostic modeling is unknown. Thus, the objectives were to conduct a scoping review of how the Royston-Parmar model has been applied to prognostic models in health research, to raise awareness of the model, to identify gaps in current reporting, and to offer model building considerations and reporting suggestions for other researchers.
Methods: Five electronic databases and gray literature indexed in web sources from 2001 to 2016 were searched to identify articles for inclusion in the scoping review. Two reviewers independently screened 1429 articles, and after applying exclusion criteria through a two-step screening process, data from 12 studies were abstracted.
Results: Since 2001, only 12 studies were identified that used the Royston-Parmar model in some capacity for prognostic modeling, 10 of which used the model as the basis for their prognostic model. The restricted cubic spline varied across studies in the number of interior knots (range 1 to 6), and only three studies reported knot placement. Three studies provided details about the baseline function, with two studies using a figure and the third providing coefficients. However, no studies provided adequate information on their restricted cubic spline to permit others to validate or completely use the model.
Conclusions: Despite the advantages of the Royston-Parmar model for prognostic models, they are not widely used in health research. Better reporting of details about the restricted cubic spline is needed, so the prognostic model can be used and validated by others. Registration: The protocol was registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/r3232/).},

The Salford Lung Study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SLS COPD) allowed broad inclusion criteria and followed patients in routine practice. We assessed whether SLS COPD approximated the England COPD population and evidence for a Hawthorne effect.
Methods This observational cohort study compared patients with COPD in the usual care arm of SLS COPD (2012\textendash{}2014) with matched non-trial patients with COPD in England from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database. Generalisability was explored with baseline demographics, clinical and treatment variables; outcomes included COPD exacerbations in adjusted models and pretrial versus peritrial comparisons.
Results Trial participants were younger (mean, 66.7 vs 71.1 years), more deprived (most deprived quintile, 51.5\% vs 21.4\%), more current smokers (47.5\% vs 32.1\%), with more severe Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages but less comorbidity than non-trial patients. There were no material differences in other characteristics. Acute COPD exacerbation rates were high in the trial population (98.37th percentile).
Conclusion The trial population was similar to the non-trial COPD population. We observed some evidence of a Hawthorne effect, with more exacerbations recorded in trial patients; however, the largest effect was observed through behavioural changes in patients and general practitioner coding practices.},

OBJECTIVE: The authors develop a risk prediction model for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression from stage III to stage IV that includes longitudinal data and features drawn from clinical documentation.
METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 2908 primary-care clinic patients who had at least three visits prior to January 1, 2013 and developed CKD stage III during their documented history. Development and validation cohorts were randomly selected from this cohort and the study datasets included longitudinal inpatient and outpatient data from these populations. Time series analysis (Kalman filter) and survival analysis (Cox proportional hazards) were combined to produce a range of risk models. These models were evaluated using concordance, a discriminatory statistic.
RESULTS: A risk model incorporating longitudinal data on clinical documentation and laboratory test results (concordance 0.849) predicts progression from state III CKD to stage IV CKD more accurately when compared to a similar model without laboratory test results (concordance 0.733, P{$<$}.001), a model that only considers the most recent laboratory test results (concordance 0.819, P {$<$} .031) and a model based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (concordance 0.779, P {$<$} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: A risk prediction model that takes longitudinal laboratory test results and clinical documentation into consideration can predict CKD progression from stage III to stage IV more accurately than three models that do not take all of these variables into consideration.},

Inclusion criteria consisted of a type 1 ECG present either at baseline or after drug challenge, after exclusion of diseases that mimic Brugada syndrome. The registry included 1029 consecutive individuals (745 men; 72\%) with a median age of 45 (35 to 55) years. Diagnosis was based on (1) aborted SCD (6\%); (2) syncope, otherwise unexplained (30\%); and (3) asymptomatic patients (64\%). During a median follow-up of 31.9 (14 to 54.4) months, 51 cardiac events (5\%) occurred (44 patients experienced appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and 7 died suddenly). The cardiac event rate per year was 7.7\% in patients with aborted SCD, 1.9\% in patients with syncope, and 0.5\% in asymptomatic patients. Symptoms and spontaneous type 1 ECG were predictors of arrhythmic events, whereas gender, familial history of SCD, inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias during electrophysiological study, and the presence of an SCN5A mutation were not predictive of arrhythmic events.Conclusions\textemdash{} In the largest series of Brugada syndrome patients thus far, event rates in asymptomatic patients were low.

  abstract = {An important aim in clinical studies in oncology is to study how treatment and prognostic factors influence the course of disease of a patient. Typically in these trials, besides overall survival, also other endpoints such as locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis are of interest. Most commonly in these situations, Cox regression models are applied for each of these endpoints separately or to composite endpoints such as disease-free survival. These approaches however fail to give insight into what happens to a patient after a first event. We re-analyzed data of 2795 patients from a breast cancer trial (EORTC 10854) by applying a multi-state model, with local recurrence, distant metastasis, and both local recurrence and distant metastasis as transient states and death as absorbing state. We used an approach where the clock is reset on entry of a new state. The influence of prognostic factors on each of the transition rates is studied, as well as the influence of the time at which intermediate events occur. The estimated transition rates between the states in the model are used to obtain predictions for patients with a given history. Formulas are developed and illustrated for these prediction probabilities for the clock reset approach. (\textcopyright{} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In medicine, many more prediction models have been developed than are implemented or used in clinical practice. These models cannot be recommended for clinical use before external validity is established. Though various models to predict mortality in dialysis patients have been published, very few have been validated and none are used in routine clinical practice. The aim of the current study was to identify existing models for predicting mortality in dialysis patients through a review and subsequently to externally validate these models in the same large independent patient cohort, in order to assess and compare their predictive capacities.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. To account for missing data, multiple imputation was performed. The original prediction formulae were extracted from selected studies. The probability of death per model was calculated for each individual within the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD). The predictive performance of the models was assessed based on their discrimination and calibration.
RESULTS: In total, 16 articles were included in the systematic review. External validation was performed in 1,943 dialysis patients from NECOSAD for a total of seven models. The models performed moderately to well in terms of discrimination, with C-statistics ranging from 0.710 (interquartile range 0.708-0.711) to 0.752 (interquartile range 0.750-0.753) for a time frame of 1 year. According to the calibration, most models overestimated the probability of death.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the performance of the models was poorer in the external validation than in the original population, affirming the importance of external validation. Floege et al's models showed the highest predictive performance. The present study is a step forward in the use of a prediction model as a useful tool for nephrologists, using evidence-based medicine that combines individual clinical expertise, patients' choices, and the best available external evidence.},

  abstract = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of {$\geq$}0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of {$\leq$} 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer.},

  abstract = {Royston (2014, Stata Journal 14: 738\textendash{}755) explained how a popular application of the Cox proportional hazards model ``is to develop a multivariable prediction model, often a prognostic model to predict the future clinical outcome of patients with a particular disorder from `baseline' factors measured at some initial time point. For such a model to be useful in practice, it must be `validated'; that is, it must perform satisfactorily in an external sample of patients independent of the one on which the model was originally developed. One key aspect of performance is calibration, which is the accuracy of prediction, particularly of survival (or equivalently, failure or event) probabilities at any time after the time origin''. In this article, I suggest an approach to assess calibration by comparing observed (Kaplan\textendash{}Meier) and predicted survival probabilities in several prognostic groups derived by placing cutpoints on the prognostic index. I distinguish between full validation, where all relevant quantities are estimated on the derivation dataset and predicted on the validation dataset, and partial validation, where the prognostic index and prognostic groups are derived from published information and the baseline distribution function is estimated in the validation dataset. Partial validation is more feasible in practice because it is uncommon to have access to individual patient values in both datasets. I exemplify the method by detailed analysis of two datasets in the disease primary biliary cirrhosis; the datasets comprise a derivation and a validation dataset. I describe a new ado-file, stcoxgrp, that performs the necessary calculations. Results for stcoxgrp are displayed graphically, which makes it easier for users to picture calibration (or lack thereof) according to follow-up time.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Backward multivariable logistic regression (P{$<$}0.05 and P{$<$}0.157) was performed with possible predictors for persistent complaints in patients with nonspecific neck pain. The continuous variables were introduced in the analysis in three separate ways: (1) continuous, (2) split into multiple categories, and (3) dichotomized. The different models were compared with regard to model content, goodness of fit, explained variation, and discriminative ability. We also compared the effect on performance of categorization before and after the selection procedure.
RESULTS: For P{$<$}0.05, the final model with continuous variables, containing five predictors, disagreed on three predictors with both categorization strategies. For P{$<$}0.157, the model with continuous variables, containing six predictors, disagreed on three predictors with the model containing stratified continuous variables and on six predictors compared with the model with dichotomized variables. The models in which the variables were kept continuous performed best. There was no clear difference in performance between categorization before and after the selection procedure.
CONCLUSION: Categorization of continuous variables resulted in a different content and poorer performance of the final model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Only a minority of patients with CKD progress to renal failure. Despite the potential benefits of risk stratification in the CKD population, risk prediction models are not routinely used. Our objective was to develop and externally validate a clinically useful and pragmatic prediction model for the 5-year risk of progression to RRT in stage 3 or 4 CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: We used a retrospective cohort design. The development cohort consisted of 22,460 Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with stage 3 or 4 CKD (baseline 2002-2008). The validation cohort consisted of 16,553 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members with stage 3-4 CKD (baseline 2006-2008). The final model included eight predictors: age, sex, eGFR, hemoglobin, proteinuria/albuminuria, systolic BP, antihypertensive medication use, and diabetes and its complications.
RESULTS: In the Northwest and Colorado cohorts, there were 737 and 360 events, and observed 5-year Kaplan-Meier risks of 4.72\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 4.38 to 5.06) and 2.57\% (95\% CI, 2.30 to 2.83), respectively. Our prediction model performed extremely well in the development cohort, with a c-statistic of 0.96, an R2 of 79.7\%, and good calibration. We had similarly good performance in the external validation cohort, with a c-statistic of 0.95, R2 of 81.2\%, and good calibration. In the external validation cohort, the observed risk was slightly lower than the predicted risk in the highest-risk quintile. Using the top quintile of predicted risk as a cutpoint gave a sensitivity of 92.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a pragmatic prediction model and risk score for predicting the 5-year RRT risk in stage 3 and 4 CKD. This model uses variables that are typically available in routine primary care settings, and can be used to help guide important decisions such as timing of referral to nephrology and fistula placement.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Elderly persons with chronic kidney disease have substantial risk for cardiovascular mortality, but the relative importance of traditional and novel risk factors is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare traditional and novel risk factors as predictors of cardiovascular mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A total of 5808 community-dwelling persons aged 65 years or older living in 4 communities in the United States participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort. Participants were initially recruited from 1989 to June 1990; an additional 687 black participants were recruited in 1992-1993. The average length of follow-up in this longitudinal study was 8.6 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiovascular mortality among those with and without chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.
RESULTS: Among the participants, 1249 (22\%) had chronic kidney disease at baseline. The cardiovascular mortality risk rate was 32 deaths/1000 person-years among those with chronic kidney disease vs 16/1000 person-years among those without it. In multivariate analyses, diabetes, systolic hypertension, smoking, low physical activity, nonuse of alcohol, and left ventricular hypertrophy were predictors of cardiovascular mortality in persons with chronic kidney disease (all P values {$<$}.05). Among the novel risk factors, only log C-reactive protein (P = .05) and log interleukin 6 (P{$<$}.001) were associated with the outcome as linear predictors. Traditional risk factors were associated with the largest absolute increases in risks for cardiovascular deaths among persons with chronic kidney disease: for left ventricular hypertrophy, there were 25 deaths per 1000 person-years; current smoking, 20 per 1000 person-years; physical inactivity, 15 per 1000 person-years; systolic hypertension, 14 per 1000 person-years; diabetes, 14 per 1000 person-years; and nonuse of alcohol, 11 per 1000 person-years vs 5 deaths per 1000 person-years for those with increased C-reactive protein and 5 per 1000 person-years for those with increased interleukin 6 levels. A receiver operating characteristic analysis found that traditional risk factors had an area under the curve of 0.73 (95\% confidence interval, 0.70-0.77) among those with chronic kidney disease. Adding novel risk factors only increased the area under the curve to 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.71-0.78; P for difference = .15).
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional cardiovascular risk factors had larger associations with cardiovascular mortality than novel risk factors in elderly persons with chronic kidney disease. Future research should investigate whether aggressive lifestyle intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease can reduce their substantial cardiovascular risk.},

  abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision\textendash{}analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are important in various fields, including medicine, physics, meteorology, and finance. Prediction models will become more relevant in the medical field with the increase in knowledge on potential predictors of outcome, e.g. from genetics. Also, the number of applications will increase, e.g. with targeted early detection of disease, and individualized approaches to diagnostic testing and treatment. The current era of evidence-based medicine asks for an individualized approach to medical decision-making. Evidence-based medicine has a central place for meta-analysis to summarize results from randomized controlled trials; similarly prediction models may summarize the effects of predictors to provide individu- ized predictions of a diagnostic or prognostic outcome. Why Read This Book? My motivation for working on this book stems primarily from the fact that the development and applications of prediction models are often suboptimal in medical publications. With this book I hope to contribute to better understanding of relevant issues and give practical advice on better modelling strategies than are nowadays widely used. Issues include: (a) Better predictive modelling is sometimes easily possible; e.g. a large data set with high quality data is available, but all continuous predictors are dich- omized, which is known to have several disadvantages.},

Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is vital for clinical decision making and patient-provider communication. We previously developed an accurate static prediction model that used single-timepoint measurements of demographic and laboratory variables.
STUDY DESIGN: Development of a dynamic predictive model using demographic, clinical, and time-dependent laboratory data from a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 to~5.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,004 patients seen April 1, 2001, to December 31, 2009, in the outpatient CKD clinic of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada.
CANDIDATE PREDICTORS: Age, sex, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum albumin, phosphorus, calcium, and bicarbonate values as time-dependent predictors.
OUTCOMES: Treated kidney failure, defined by initiation of dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: We describe a dynamic (latest-available-measurement) prediction model using time-dependent laboratory values as predictors of outcome. Our static model included all 8 candidate predictors. The latest-available-measurement model includes age and the latter 5 variables as time-dependent predictors. We used Cox proportional hazards models for time to kidney failure and compared discrimination, calibration, model fit, and net reclassification for the models.
RESULTS: We studied 3,004 patients, who had 344 kidney failure events over a median follow-up of 3 years and an average of 5 clinic visits. eGFR was more strongly associated with kidney failure in the latest-available-measurement model versus the baseline visit static model (HR, 0.44 vs 0.65). The association of calcium level was unchanged, but male sex and phosphorus, albumin, and bicarbonate levels were no longer significant. Discrimination and goodness of fit showed incremental improvement with inclusion of time-dependent covariates (integrated discrimination improvement, 0.73\%; 95\% CI, 0.56\%-0.90\%).
LIMITATIONS: Our data were derived from a nephrology clinic at a single center. We were unable to include time-dependent changes in albuminuria.
CONCLUSIONS: A latest-available-measurement predictive model with eGFR as a time-dependent predictor can incrementally improve risk prediction for kidney failure over a static model with only a single eGFR.},

Kidney disease severity can be classified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, but more accurate information regarding risk for progression to kidney failure is required for clinical decisions about testing, treatment, and referral.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate predictive models for progression of CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Development and validation of prediction models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 2 independent Canadian cohorts of patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated GFR, 10-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) who were referred to nephrologists between April 1, 2001, and December 31, 2008. Models were developed using Cox proportional hazards regression methods and evaluated using C statistics and integrated discrimination improvement for discrimination, calibration plots and Akaike Information Criterion for goodness of fit, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) at 1, 3, and 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Kidney failure, defined as need for dialysis or preemptive kidney transplantation.
RESULTS: The development and validation cohorts included 3449 patients (386 with kidney failure [11\%]) and 4942 patients (1177 with kidney failure [24\%]), respectively. The most accurate model included age, sex, estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum bicarbonate, and serum albumin (C statistic, 0.917; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.901-0.933 in the development cohort and 0.841; 95\% CI, 0.825-0.857 in the validation cohort). In the validation cohort, this model was more accurate than a simpler model that included age, sex, estimated GFR, and albuminuria (integrated discrimination improvement, 3.2\%; 95\% CI, 2.4\%-4.2\%; calibration [Nam and D'Agostino {$\chi$}(2) statistic, 19 vs 32]; and reclassification for CKD stage 3 [NRI, 8.0\%; 95\% CI, 2.1\%-13.9\%] and for CKD stage 4 [NRI, 4.1\%; 95\% CI, -0.5\% to 8.8\%]).
CONCLUSION: A model using routinely obtained laboratory tests can accurately predict progression to kidney failure in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Accurate models are needed to predict the individual risk for these outcomes.
PURPOSE: To systematically review risk prediction models for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and death in patients with CKD.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search of English-language articles published from 1966 to November 2012.
STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that examined adults with any stage of CKD who were not receiving dialysis and had not had a transplant; had at least 1 year of follow-up; and reported on a model that predicted the risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, or all-cause mortality.
DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers extracted data on study design, population characteristics, modeling methods, metrics of model performance, risk of bias, and clinical usefulness.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen studies describing 23 models were found. Eight studies (11 models) involved kidney failure, 5 studies (6 models) involved all-cause mortality, and 3 studies (6 models) involved cardiovascular events. Measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum creatinine level were included in 10 studies (17 models), and measures of proteinuria were included in 9 studies (15 models). Only 2 studies (4 models) met the criteria for clinical usefulness, of which 1 study (3 models) presented reclassification indices with clinically useful risk categories.
LIMITATION: A validated risk-of-bias tool and comparisons of the performance of different models in the same validation population were lacking.
CONCLUSION: Accurate, externally validated models for predicting risk for kidney failure in patients with CKD are available and ready for clinical testing. Further development of models for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality is needed.

  abstract = {Background
Outpatients with heart failure (HF) who are at high risk for HF hospitalization and/or death may benefit from early identification. We sought to develop and externally validate a model to predict both HF hospitalization and mortality that accounts for the semi-competing nature of the two outcomes and captures the risk associated with the transition from the stable outpatient state to the post-HF hospitalization state.

Methods and Results
A multi-state model to predict HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality was derived using data (n=3834) from the Heart Failure Endpoint evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (HEAAL) study, a multinational randomized trial in symptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Twelve easily and reliably obtainable demographic and clinical predictors were pre-specified for model inclusion. Model performance was assessed in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) cohort (n=2521). At one year, the probability of being alive without HF hospitalization was 94\% for a typical patient in the lowest risk quintile and 77\% for a typical patient in the highest risk quintile and this variability in risk continued through 7 years of follow up. The model c-index was 0.72 in the derivation cohort, 0.66 in the validation cohort and 0.69 in the implantable cardiac defibrillator arm of the validation cohort. There was excellent calibration across quintiles of predicted risk.

Conclusions
Our findings illustrate the advantages of a multi-state modeling approach - providing estimates of HF hospitalization and death in the same model, comparison of predictors for the different outcomes and demonstrating the different trajectories of patients based on baseline characteristics and intermediary events.},

  abstract = {The act of diagnosis requires that patients be placed in a binary category of either having or not having a certain disease. Accordingly, the diseases of particular concern for industrialized countries--such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or depression--require that a somewhat arbitrary cut-point be chosen on a continuous scale of measurement (for example, a fasting glucose level {$>$}6.9 mmol/L [{$>$}125 mg/dL] for type 2 diabetes). These cut-points do not adequately reflect disease biology, may inappropriately treat patients on either side of the cut-point as 2 homogenous risk groups, fail to incorporate other risk factors, and are invariable to patient preference. This article discusses risk prediction as an alternative to diagnosis: Patient risk factors (blood pressure, age) are combined into a single statistical model (risk for a cardiovascular event within 10 years) and the results are used in shared decision making about possible treatments. The authors compare and contrast the diagnostic and risk prediction approaches and attempt to identify the types of medical problem to which each is best suited.},

However, the dichotomy of continuous data is associated with loss of statistical power, which may result in inaccurate estimates in clinical prognosis or prediction of outcomes and, consequently, may lead to incorrect inferences. If the predictor is a continuous variable, arbitrary percentile-based categorizations without clinical justification is an anathema (Greek word meaning "curse") and should be discouraged. Instead, the clinical outcome of interest should be defined first and then a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis or other appropriate statistical techniques should be employed to determine the most optimal cutoff of the predictor. The next step should be to validate the cutoff in a different population before introducing it to clinical use or interventional trials.},

  abstract = {Objective Since 2010, England has experienced relative constraints in public expenditure on healthcare (PEH) and social care (PES). We sought to determine whether these constraints have affected mortality rates.
Methods We collected data on health and social care resources and finances for England from 2001 to 2014. Time trend analyses were conducted to compare the actual mortality rates in 2011\textendash{}2014 with the counterfactual rates expected based on trends before spending constraints. Fixed-effects regression analyses were conducted using annual data on PES and PEH with mortality as the outcome, with further adjustments for macroeconomic factors and resources. Analyses were stratified by age group, place of death and lower-tier local authority (n=325). Mortality rates to 2020 were projected based on recent trends.
Results Spending constraints between 2010 and 2014 were associated with an estimated 45 368 (95\% CI 34 530 to 56 206) higher than expected number of deaths compared with pre-2010 trends. Deaths in those aged {$\geq$}60 and in care homes accounted for the majority. PES was more strongly linked with care home and home mortality than PEH, with each \textsterling{}10 per capita decline in real PES associated with an increase of 5.10 (3.65\textendash{}6.54) (p{$<$}0.001) care home deaths per 100 000. These associations persisted in lag analyses and after adjustment for macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, we found that changes in real PES per capita may be linked to mortality mostly via changes in nurse numbers. Projections to 2020 based on 2009-2014 trend was cumulatively linked to an estimated 152 141 (95\% CI 134 597 and 169 685) additional deaths.
Conclusions Spending constraints, especially PES, are associated with a substantial mortality gap. We suggest that spending should be targeted on improving care delivered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or increasing nurse numbers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the utility of the Framingham equations in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
BACKGROUND: The Framingham equations predict incident coronary disease. The utility of these equations is unknown in CKD.
METHODS: We pooled individuals without pre-existing coronary disease age 45 to 74 years from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) trials with CKD, defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Using gender-specific models, we determined 5- and 10-year risk of incident myocardial infarction and fatal coronary disease, and evaluated discriminative and calibration ability of the Framingham equations for predicting coronary events.
RESULTS: There were 577 women and 357 men with CKD. Thirty-five men (9.8\%) and 30 women (5.2\%) and 74 men (20.7\%) and 56 women (9.7\%) had cardiac events within 5 and 10 years, respectively; 5-year events were predicted in 6.0\% and 1.9\% and 10-year events in 13.9\% and 4.8\% of men and women, respectively. For 5-year events, C-statistics assessing discrimination were 0.62 and 0.77, while 10-year C-statistics were 0.60 and 0.73 for men and women, respectively. Calibration was also poor, with Framingham scores generally underpredicting events in individuals with CKD at 5 and 10 years. Discrimination was significantly improved by refitting models with population-specific coefficients, while recalibration improved prediction in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The Framingham instrument demonstrates poor overall accuracy in predicting cardiac events in individuals with CKD, although refit models can substantially improve discrimination. Calibration in women can be moderately improved with adjustment for higher event rates. Development of CKD-specific equations is needed.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and is typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in regression analysis when covariates have missing values. Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on the outcome. With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is not clear., We assume that the survival outcome follows a proportional hazards model given covariates X and Z. We show that a suitable model for imputing binary or Normal X is a logistic or linear regression on the event indicator D, the cumulative baseline hazard H0(T), and the other covariates Z. This result is exact in the case of a single binary covariate; in other cases, it is approximately valid for small covariate effects and/or small cumulative incidence. If we do not know H0(T), we approximate it by the Nelson\textendash{}Aalen estimator of H(T) or estimate it by Cox regression., We compare the methods using simulation studies. We find that using log T biases covariate-outcome associations towards the null, while the new methods have lower bias. Overall, we recommend including the event indicator and the Nelson\textendash{}Aalen estimator of H(T) in the imputation model. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information on an individual's risk for death following dialysis therapy initiation may inform the decision to initiate maintenance dialysis for older adults. We derived and validated a clinical risk prediction tool for all-cause mortality among older adults during the first 6 months of maintenance dialysis treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Prediction model using retrospective administrative and clinical data.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: We linked administrative and clinical data to define a cohort of 2,199 older adults (age~{$\geq$} 65 years) in Alberta, Canada, who initiated maintenance dialysis therapy (excluding acute kidney injury) in May 2003 to March~2012.
CANDIDATE PREDICTORS: Demographics, laboratory data, comorbid conditions, and measures of health system use.
OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality within 6 months of dialysis therapy initiation.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Predicted mortality by logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: 375 (17.1\%) older adults died within 6 months. We developed a 19-point risk score for 6-month mortality that included age 80 years or older (2 points), glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 14.9mL/min/1.73m2 (1 point) or~{$\geq$}15mL/min/1.73m2 (3 points), atrial fibrillation (2 points), lymphoma (5 points), congestive heart failure (2 points), hospitalization in the prior 6 months (2 points), and metastatic cancer (3 points). Model discrimination (C statistic~= 0.72) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow {$\chi$}2=10.36; P=0.2) were reasonable. As examples, a score~{$<$} 5 equated to~{$<$}25\% of individuals dying in 6 months, whereas a score {$>$} 12 predicted that more than half the individuals would die in the first 6 months.
LIMITATIONS: The tool has not been externally validated; thus, generalizability cannot be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: We used readily available clinical information to derive and internally validate a 7-variable tool to predict early mortality among older adults after dialysis therapy initiation. Following successful external validation, the tool may be useful as a clinical decision tool to aid decision making for older adults with kidney failure.},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic literature studies have become common in software engineering, and hence it is important to understand how to conduct them efficiently and reliably.
Objective: This paper presents guidelines for conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature review.
Method: The guidelines are based on the experience from conducting several systematic literature reviews and experimenting with different approaches.
Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature review.
Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is a popular technique for analysing incomplete data. Given the imputed data and a particular model, Rubin's rules (RR) for estimating parameters and standard errors are well established. However, there are currently no guidelines for variable selection in multiply imputed data sets. The usual practice is to perform variable selection amongst the complete cases, a simple but inefficient and potentially biased procedure. Alternatively, variable selection can be performed by repeated use of RR, which is more computationally demanding. An approximation can be obtained by a simple 'stacked' method that combines the multiply imputed data sets into one and uses a weighting scheme to account for the fraction of missing data in each covariate. We compare these and other approaches using simulations based around a trial in community psychiatry. Most methods improve on the na{\"i}ve complete-case analysis for variable selection, but importantly the type 1 error is only preserved if selection is based on RR, which is our recommended approach.},
