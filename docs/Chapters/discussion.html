<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>This is the first paper to investigate the issue of unmeasured confounding on a treatment effect in a competing risks scenario. Herein, we have demonstrated that regardless of the actual effect of a treatment on a population that is susceptible to competing risks, bias can be induced by the presence of unmeasured confounding. This bias is largely determined by the strength of the confounding relationship with the treatment decision and size of confounding effect on both the event-of-interest and any competing events. This effect is present regardless of any difference in event rates between the events being investigated and is also exacerbated by misbalances in the number of patients who received treatment and the number of patients who did not.</p>
<p>Our study has shown how different the case would be if a similar population (without inclusion/exclusion criteria) were put through an RCT and how the correlation between an unmeasured confounder and the treatment is removed, as would be the case in a pragmatic RCT. By combining the biases from an RCT and the explicitly calculated treatment effect, we can also use these results to infer how much of the bias found here is from omitted variable bias [22] and how much is explicitly due to the correlation between the covariates. Omitted variable bias occurs when a missing covariate has an effect on the outcome, but is not correlated with the treatment (and so is not a true confounder). It can occur even if the omitted variable is initially evenly distributed between the two treatment arms because, as patients on one arm have events earlier than the other, the distributions of the omitted variable drift apart. This makes up some of the bias caused by unmeasured confounding, but not all of it. For example, in Scenario 3 (Differential Effect), the treatment lowered the hazard of the event-of-interest, but increased the hazard of the competing event; with a median level of correlation (<span class="math inline">\(\rho=0.4\)</span>), the event-of-interest bias from the RCT when there is a negative confounding effect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1&lt;0\)</span>) is -0.628 and the bias from the explicit estimate is <span class="math inline">\(0.295\)</span> and therefore, the amount of bias due purely to the correlation between the unmeasured confounder and the treatment is actually -0.923. In this instance, some of the omitted variable bias is actually mitigating the bias from the correlation; if we have two biasing effects that can potentially cancel each other out, we could encounter a Type III error [23] which is very difficult to prove and can cause huge problems for reproducibility (if you eliminate a single source of bias, your results will be farther from the truth).</p>
<p>Our simulations indicate that a higher (lower) value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and a lower (higher) value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> will produce a higher (lower) bias in the event-of-interest. These two biasing effects could cancel out to produce a situation similar to above. In our scenarios, we saw that, even when a treatment has no effect on the event-of-interest or a competing event (i.e. the treatment is a placebo), both a cause specific treatment effect and a subdistribution treatment effect can be found. This also implies that the biasing effect of unmeasured confounders (both omitted variable and correlation bias) can result in researchers reaching incorrect conclusions about how a treatment affects a population in multiple ways. We could have a treatment that is beneficial for the prevention of both types of event, but due to the effects of an unmeasured confounder, it could be found to have a detrimental effect (for one or both) on patients from a subdistribution perspective.</p>
<p>Our investigation augments Lin et al’s study into unmeasured confounding in a Cox model [5] by extending their conclusion (that bias is in the same direction as the confounder’s effect and dependent on its strength) into a competing risks framework (i.e. by considering the Fine &amp; Gray model as well) and demonstrating that this effect is reversed when there is confounding with the competing event. Lin et al. [5] also highlight the problems of omitted variable bias, which comes from further misspecification of the model; this finding was observed in our results as described above for Scenario 3.</p>
<p>The results from Scenario 7 (Weibull Distribution) and Scenario 8 (Plausible Distribution) are almost identical to those of Scenario 1 (No Effect) which implies that, by assuming both hazard functions in question are the same, we can assume they are both constant for simplicity. Since both the Cox and Fine &amp; Gray models are ambiguous to underlying hazard functions and treatment effects are estimated without consideration for the baseline hazard function, it makes intuitive sense that the results would be identical regardless of what underlying functions were used to generate our data. This makes calculation of the explicit subdistribution treatment effect much simpler for future researchers.</p>
<p>Thompson et al. used the paradox that smoking reduces melanoma risk to motivate simulations similar to ours, which demonstrated how the exclusion of competing risks, when assessing confounding, can lead to unintuitive, mis-specified and possibly dangerous conclusions [24]. They hypothesised that the association found elsewhere [25] may be caused by bias due to ignoring competing events and used Monte Carlo simulations to provide examples of scenarios where these results would be possible. They demonstrated how a competing event could cause incorrect conclusions when that competing event is ignored - a conclusion we also confirm through the existence of bias induced on the Cox modelled treatment effect even with no correlation between the unmeasured confounder and treatment (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{\textrm{CSH,1}} \neq 0\)</span> in Scenarios 2 &amp; 3). Thompson’s team began with a situation where there may be a bias due to a competing event and reverse-engineered a scenario to find the potential sources of bias, whereas our study explored different scenarios and investigated the biased results they potentially produced.</p>
<p>Groenwold et al. [26] proposed methods to perform simulations to evaluate how much unmeasured confounding would be necessary for a true effect to be null given that an effect has been found in the data. Their methods can easily be applied to any metric in clinical studies (such as the different hazard ratios estimated here). Currently, epidemiologists will instigate methods such as DAGs, see Fig. @ref(fig:Model_DAG), to visualise where unmeasured confounding may be a problem in analysis [27] and statisticians who deal with such models will use transition diagrams, see Fig. @ref(fig:Model_Transitions), to visualise potential patient pathways [28]. Using these two visualisation techniques in parallel will allow researchers to anticipate these issues, successfully plan to combat them (through changes to protocol or sensitivity analysis, etc. …) and/or implement simulations to seek hidden sources of bias (using the methods of Groenwold [26] and Thompson [24]) or to adjust their findings by assuming biases similar to those demonstrated in our paper exist in their work.</p>
<p>The work presented here could be extended to include more complicated designs such as more competing events, more covariates and differing hazard functions. However, the intention of this paper was to provide a simple dissection of specific scenarios that allow for generalisation to clinical work. The main limitation of this work, to use of the same hazard functions for both events in each of our scenarios, was a pragmatic decision made to reduce computation time. The next largest limitation was the lack of censoring events, and was chosen to simplify interpretation of the model. This situation is unlikely to happen in the real world. However, since both the Cox and the Fine &amp; Gray modelling techniques are robust to any underlying baseline hazard and independent censoring of patients [14, 15, 29], these simplifications should not have had a detrimental effect on the bias estimates given in this paper. This perspective on censoring is similar to the view of Lesko et al. [30] in that censoring would provide less clarity of the presented results.</p>
