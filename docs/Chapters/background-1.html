<p>Well-designed observation studies permit researchers to assess treatment effects when randomisation is not feasible. This may be due to cost, suspected non-equipoise treatments or any number of other reasons [1]. While observational studies minimise these issues by being cheaper to run and avoiding randomisation (which, although unknown at the time, may prescribe patients to worse treatments), they are potentially subject to issues such as unmeasured confounding and increased possibility of competing risks (where multiple clinically relevant events occur). Although these issues can arise in any study, Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) attempt to mitigate these effects by using randomisation of treatment and strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, the estimated treatment effects from RCTs are of potentially limited generalisability, accessibility and implementability [2].</p>
<p>A confounder is a variable that is a common cause of both treatment and outcome. For example, a patient with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) is more likely to be prescribed statins [3], but are also more likely to suffer a cardiovascular event. These treatment decisions can be affected by variables that are not routinely collected (such as childhood socio-economic status or the severity of a comorbidity [4]. Therefore, if these variables are omitted form (or unavailable for) the analysis of treatment effects in observational studies, then they can bias inferences [5]. As well as having a direct effect on the event-of-interest, confounders (along with other covariates) can also have further reaching effects on a patient’s health by changing the chances of having a competing event. Patients who are more likely to have a competing event are less likely to have an event-of-interest, which can affect inferences from studies ignoring the competing event. In the above BMI example, a high BMI can also increase a patient’s likelihood of developing (and thus dying from) cancer [6].</p>
<p>The issue of confounding in observational studies has been researched previously [7,8,9], where it has been consistently shown that unmeasured confounding is likely to occur within these natural datasets and that there is poor reporting of this, even after the introduction of the The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Guidelines [10, 11]. Hence, it is widely recognised that sensitivity analyses are vital within the observational setting [12]. However these previous studies do not extend this work into a competing risk setting, meaning research in this space is lacking [13], particularly where the presence of a competing event can affect the rate of occurrence of the event-of-interest. These issues will commonly occur in elderly and comorbid patients where treatment decisions are more complex. As the elderly population grows, the clinical community needs to understand the optimal way to treat patients with complex conditions; here, causal relationships between treatment and outcome need to account for competing events appropriately.</p>
<p>The most common way of analysing data that contains competing events is using a cause specific perspective, as in the Cox methodology [14], where competing events are considered as censoring events and analysis focuses solely on the event-of-interest. The alternative is to assume a subdistributional perspective, as in the Fine &amp; Gray methodology [15], where patients who have competing events remain in the risk set forever.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to study the bias induced by the presence of unmeasured confounding on treatment effect estimates in the competing risks framework. We investigated how unmeasured confounding affects the apparent effect of treatment under the Fine &amp; Gray and the Cox methodologies and how these estimates differ from their true value. To accomplish this, we used simulations to generate synthetic time-to-event-data and then model under both perspectives. Both the Cox and Fine &amp; Gray models provide hazard ratios to describe the effects of a covariate. A binary covariate will represent a treatment and the coefficients found by the model will be the estimate of interest.</p>
